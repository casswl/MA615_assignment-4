55 "The Cyclone>"
55 ""
55 ""
55 "Dorothy lived in the midst of the great Kansas prairies, with Uncle"
55 "Henry, who was a farmer, and Aunt Em, who was the farmer’s wife. Their"
55 "house was small, for the lumber to build it had to be carried by wagon"
55 "many miles. There were four walls, a floor and a roof, which made one"
55 "room; and this room contained a rusty looking cookstove, a cupboard for"
55 "the dishes, a table, three or four chairs, and the beds. Uncle Henry"
55 "and Aunt Em had a big bed in one corner, and Dorothy a little bed in"
55 "another corner. There was no garret at all, and no cellar—except a"
55 "small hole dug in the ground, called a cyclone cellar, where the family"
55 "could go in case one of those great whirlwinds arose, mighty enough to"
55 "crush any building in its path. It was reached by a trap door in the"
55 "middle of the floor, from which a ladder led down into the small, dark"
55 "hole."
55 ""
55 "When Dorothy stood in the doorway and looked around, she could see"
55 "nothing but the great gray prairie on every side. Not a tree nor a"
55 "house broke the broad sweep of flat country that reached to the edge of"
55 "the sky in all directions. The sun had baked the plowed land into a"
55 "gray mass, with little cracks running through it. Even the grass was"
55 "not green, for the sun had burned the tops of the long blades until"
55 "they were the same gray color to be seen everywhere. Once the house had"
55 "been painted, but the sun blistered the paint and the rains washed it"
55 "away, and now the house was as dull and gray as everything else."
55 ""
55 "When Aunt Em came there to live she was a young, pretty wife. The sun"
55 "and wind had changed her, too. They had taken the sparkle from her eyes"
55 "and left them a sober gray; they had taken the red from her cheeks and"
55 "lips, and they were gray also. She was thin and gaunt, and never smiled"
55 "now. When Dorothy, who was an orphan, first came to her, Aunt Em had"
55 "been so startled by the child’s laughter that she would scream and"
55 "press her hand upon her heart whenever Dorothy’s merry voice reached"
55 "her ears; and she still looked at the little girl with wonder that she"
55 "could find anything to laugh at."
55 ""
55 "Uncle Henry never laughed. He worked hard from morning till night and"
55 "did not know what joy was. He was gray also, from his long beard to his"
55 "rough boots, and he looked stern and solemn, and rarely spoke."
55 ""
55 "It was Toto that made Dorothy laugh, and saved her from growing as gray"
55 "as her other surroundings. Toto was not gray; he was a little black"
55 "dog, with long silky hair and small black eyes that twinkled merrily on"
55 "either side of his funny, wee nose. Toto played all day long, and"
55 "Dorothy played with him, and loved him dearly."
55 ""
55 "Today, however, they were not playing. Uncle Henry sat upon the"
55 "doorstep and looked anxiously at the sky, which was even grayer than"
55 "usual. Dorothy stood in the door with Toto in her arms, and looked at"
55 "the sky too. Aunt Em was washing the dishes."
55 ""
55 "From the far north they heard a low wail of the wind, and Uncle Henry"
55 "and Dorothy could see where the long grass bowed in waves before the"
55 "coming storm. There now came a sharp whistling in the air from the"
55 "south, and as they turned their eyes that way they saw ripples in the"
55 "grass coming from that direction also."
55 ""
55 "Suddenly Uncle Henry stood up."
55 ""
55 "“There’s a cyclone coming, Em,” he called to his wife. “I’ll go look"
55 "after the stock.” Then he ran toward the sheds where the cows and"
55 "horses were kept."
55 ""
55 "Aunt Em dropped her work and came to the door. One glance told her of"
55 "the danger close at hand."
55 ""
55 "“Quick, Dorothy!” she screamed. “Run for the cellar!”"
55 ""
55 "Toto jumped out of Dorothy’s arms and hid under the bed, and the girl"
55 "started to get him. Aunt Em, badly frightened, threw open the trap door"
55 "in the floor and climbed down the ladder into the small, dark hole."
55 "Dorothy caught Toto at last and started to follow her aunt. When she"
55 "was halfway across the room there came a great shriek from the wind,"
55 "and the house shook so hard that she lost her footing and sat down"
55 "suddenly upon the floor."
55 ""
55 "Then a strange thing happened."
55 ""
55 "The house whirled around two or three times and rose slowly through the"
55 "air. Dorothy felt as if she were going up in a balloon."
55 ""
55 "The north and south winds met where the house stood, and made it the"
55 "exact center of the cyclone. In the middle of a cyclone the air is"
55 "generally still, but the great pressure of the wind on every side of"
55 "the house raised it up higher and higher, until it was at the very top"
55 "of the cyclone; and there it remained and was carried miles and miles"
55 "away as easily as you could carry a feather."
55 ""
55 "It was very dark, and the wind howled horribly around her, but Dorothy"
55 "found she was riding quite easily. After the first few whirls around,"
55 "and one other time when the house tipped badly, she felt as if she were"
55 "being rocked gently, like a baby in a cradle."
55 ""
55 "Toto did not like it. He ran about the room, now here, now there,"
55 "barking loudly; but Dorothy sat quite still on the floor and waited to"
55 "see what would happen."
55 ""
55 "Once Toto got too near the open trap door, and fell in; and at first"
55 "the little girl thought she had lost him. But soon she saw one of his"
55 "ears sticking up through the hole, for the strong pressure of the air"
55 "was keeping him up so that he could not fall. She crept to the hole,"
55 "caught Toto by the ear, and dragged him into the room again, afterward"
55 "closing the trap door so that no more accidents could happen."
55 ""
55 "Hour after hour passed away, and slowly Dorothy got over her fright;"
55 "but she felt quite lonely, and the wind shrieked so loudly all about"
55 "her that she nearly became deaf. At first she had wondered if she would"
55 "be dashed to pieces when the house fell again; but as the hours passed"
55 "and nothing terrible happened, she stopped worrying and resolved to"
55 "wait calmly and see what the future would bring. At last she crawled"
55 "over the swaying floor to her bed, and lay down upon it; and Toto"
55 "followed and lay down beside her."
55 ""
55 "In spite of the swaying of the house and the wailing of the wind,"
55 "Dorothy soon closed her eyes and fell fast asleep."

55 "The Council with the Munchkins>"

55 ""
55 "She was awakened by a shock, so sudden and severe that if Dorothy had"
55 "not been lying on the soft bed she might have been hurt. As it was, the"
55 "jar made her catch her breath and wonder what had happened; and Toto"
55 "put his cold little nose into her face and whined dismally. Dorothy sat"
55 "up and noticed that the house was not moving; nor was it dark, for the"
55 "bright sunshine came in at the window, flooding the little room. She"
55 "sprang from her bed and with Toto at her heels ran and opened the door."
55 ""
55 "The little girl gave a cry of amazement and looked about her, her eyes"
55 "growing bigger and bigger at the wonderful sights she saw."
55 ""
55 "The cyclone had set the house down very gently—for a cyclone—in the"
55 "midst of a country of marvelous beauty. There were lovely patches of"
55 "greensward all about, with stately trees bearing rich and luscious"
55 "fruits. Banks of gorgeous flowers were on every hand, and birds with"
55 "rare and brilliant plumage sang and fluttered in the trees and bushes."
55 "A little way off was a small brook, rushing and sparkling along between"
55 "green banks, and murmuring in a voice very grateful to a little girl"
55 "who had lived so long on the dry, gray prairies."
55 ""
55 "While she stood looking eagerly at the strange and beautiful sights,"
55 "she noticed coming toward her a group of the queerest people she had"
55 "ever seen. They were not as big as the grown folk she had always been"
55 "used to; but neither were they very small. In fact, they seemed about"
55 "as tall as Dorothy, who was a well-grown child for her age, although"
55 "they were, so far as looks go, many years older."
55 ""
55 "Three were men and one a woman, and all were oddly dressed. They wore"
55 "round hats that rose to a small point a foot above their heads, with"
55 "little bells around the brims that tinkled sweetly as they moved. The"
55 "hats of the men were blue; the little woman’s hat was white, and she"
55 "wore a white gown that hung in pleats from her shoulders. Over it were"
55 "sprinkled little stars that glistened in the sun like diamonds. The men"
55 "were dressed in blue, of the same shade as their hats, and wore"
55 "well-polished boots with a deep roll of blue at the tops. The men,"
55 "Dorothy thought, were about as old as Uncle Henry, for two of them had"
55 "beards. But the little woman was doubtless much older. Her face was"
55 "covered with wrinkles, her hair was nearly white, and she walked rather"
55 "stiffly."
55 ""
55 "When these people drew near the house where Dorothy was standing in the"
55 "doorway, they paused and whispered among themselves, as if afraid to"
55 "come farther. But the little old woman walked up to Dorothy, made a low"
55 "bow and said, in a sweet voice:"
55 ""
55 "“You are welcome, most noble Sorceress, to the land of the Munchkins."
55 "We are so grateful to you for having killed the Wicked Witch of the"
55 "East, and for setting our people free from bondage.”"
55 ""
55 "Dorothy listened to this speech with wonder. What could the little"
55 "woman possibly mean by calling her a sorceress, and saying she had"
55 "killed the Wicked Witch of the East? Dorothy was an innocent, harmless"
55 "little girl, who had been carried by a cyclone many miles from home;"
55 "and she had never killed anything in all her life."
55 ""
55 "But the little woman evidently expected her to answer; so Dorothy said,"
55 "with hesitation, “You are very kind, but there must be some mistake. I"
55 "have not killed anything.”"
55 ""
55 "“Your house did, anyway,” replied the little old woman, with a laugh,"
55 "“and that is the same thing. See!” she continued, pointing to the"
55 "corner of the house. “There are her two feet, still sticking out from"
55 "under a block of wood.”"
55 ""
55 "Dorothy looked, and gave a little cry of fright. There, indeed, just"
55 "under the corner of the great beam the house rested on, two feet were"
55 "sticking out, shod in silver shoes with pointed toes."
55 ""
55 "“Oh, dear! Oh, dear!” cried Dorothy, clasping her hands together in"
55 "dismay. “The house must have fallen on her. Whatever shall we do?”"
55 ""
55 "“There is nothing to be done,” said the little woman calmly."
55 ""
55 "“But who was she?” asked Dorothy."
55 ""
55 "“She was the Wicked Witch of the East, as I said,” answered the little"
55 "woman. “She has held all the Munchkins in bondage for many years,"
55 "making them slave for her night and day. Now they are all set free, and"
55 "are grateful to you for the favor.”"
55 ""
55 "“Who are the Munchkins?” inquired Dorothy."
55 ""
55 "“They are the people who live in this land of the East where the Wicked"
55 "Witch ruled.”"
55 ""
55 "“Are you a Munchkin?” asked Dorothy."
55 ""
55 "“No, but I am their friend, although I live in the land of the North."
55 "When they saw the Witch of the East was dead the Munchkins sent a swift"
55 "messenger to me, and I came at once. I am the Witch of the North.”"
55 ""
55 "“Oh, gracious!” cried Dorothy. “Are you a real witch?”"
55 ""
55 "“Yes, indeed,” answered the little woman. “But I am a good witch, and"
55 "the people love me. I am not as powerful as the Wicked Witch was who"
55 "ruled here, or I should have set the people free myself.”"
55 ""
55 "“But I thought all witches were wicked,” said the girl, who was half"
55 "frightened at facing a real witch. “Oh, no, that is a great mistake."
55 "There were only four witches in all the Land of Oz, and two of them,"
55 "those who live in the North and the South, are good witches. I know"
55 "this is true, for I am one of them myself, and cannot be mistaken."
55 "Those who dwelt in the East and the West were, indeed, wicked witches;"
55 "but now that you have killed one of them, there is but one Wicked Witch"
55 "in all the Land of Oz—the one who lives in the West.”"
55 ""
55 "“But,” said Dorothy, after a moment’s thought, “Aunt Em has told me"
55 "that the witches were all dead—years and years ago.”"
55 ""
55 "“Who is Aunt Em?” inquired the little old woman."
55 ""
55 "“She is my aunt who lives in Kansas, where I came from.”"
55 ""
55 "The Witch of the North seemed to think for a time, with her head bowed"
55 "and her eyes upon the ground. Then she looked up and said, “I do not"
55 "know where Kansas is, for I have never heard that country mentioned"
55 "before. But tell me, is it a civilized country?”"
55 ""
55 "“Oh, yes,” replied Dorothy."
55 ""
55 "“Then that accounts for it. In the civilized countries I believe there"
55 "are no witches left, nor wizards, nor sorceresses, nor magicians. But,"
55 "you see, the Land of Oz has never been civilized, for we are cut off"
55 "from all the rest of the world. Therefore we still have witches and"
55 "wizards amongst us.”"
55 ""
55 "“Who are the wizards?” asked Dorothy."
55 ""
55 "“Oz himself is the Great Wizard,” answered the Witch, sinking her voice"
55 "to a whisper. “He is more powerful than all the rest of us together. He"
55 "lives in the City of Emeralds.”"
55 ""
55 "Dorothy was going to ask another question, but just then the Munchkins,"
55 "who had been standing silently by, gave a loud shout and pointed to the"
55 "corner of the house where the Wicked Witch had been lying."
55 ""
55 "“What is it?” asked the little old woman, and looked, and began to"
55 "laugh. The feet of the dead Witch had disappeared entirely, and nothing"
55 "was left but the silver shoes."
55 ""
55 "“She was so old,” explained the Witch of the North, “that she dried up"
55 "quickly in the sun. That is the end of her. But the silver shoes are"
55 "yours, and you shall have them to wear.” She reached down and picked up"
55 "the shoes, and after shaking the dust out of them handed them to"
55 "Dorothy."
55 ""
55 "“The Witch of the East was proud of those silver shoes,” said one of"
55 "the Munchkins, “and there is some charm connected with them; but what"
55 "it is we never knew.”"
55 ""
55 "Dorothy carried the shoes into the house and placed them on the table."
55 "Then she came out again to the Munchkins and said:"
55 ""
55 "“I am anxious to get back to my aunt and uncle, for I am sure they will"
55 "worry about me. Can you help me find my way?”"
55 ""
55 "The Munchkins and the Witch first looked at one another, and then at"
55 "Dorothy, and then shook their heads."
55 ""
55 "“At the East, not far from here,” said one, “there is a great desert,"
55 "and none could live to cross it.”"
55 ""
55 "“It is the same at the South,” said another, “for I have been there and"
55 "seen it. The South is the country of the Quadlings.”"
55 ""
55 "“I am told,” said the third man, “that it is the same at the West. And"
55 "that country, where the Winkies live, is ruled by the Wicked Witch of"
55 "the West, who would make you her slave if you passed her way.”"
55 ""
55 "“The North is my home,” said the old lady, “and at its edge is the same"
55 "great desert that surrounds this Land of Oz. I’m afraid, my dear, you"
55 "will have to live with us.”"
55 ""
55 "Dorothy began to sob at this, for she felt lonely among all these"
55 "strange people. Her tears seemed to grieve the kind-hearted Munchkins,"
55 "for they immediately took out their handkerchiefs and began to weep"
55 "also. As for the little old woman, she took off her cap and balanced"
55 "the point on the end of her nose, while she counted “One, two, three”"
55 "in a solemn voice. At once the cap changed to a slate, on which was"
55 "written in big, white chalk marks:"
55 ""
55 "“LET DOROTHY GO TO THE CITY OF EMERALDS”"
55 ""
55 ""
55 "The little old woman took the slate from her nose, and having read the"
55 "words on it, asked, “Is your name Dorothy, my dear?”"
55 ""
55 "“Yes,” answered the child, looking up and drying her tears."
55 ""
55 "“Then you must go to the City of Emeralds. Perhaps Oz will help you.”"
55 ""
55 "“Where is this city?” asked Dorothy."
55 ""
55 "“It is exactly in the center of the country, and is ruled by Oz, the"
55 "Great Wizard I told you of.”"
55 ""
55 "“Is he a good man?” inquired the girl anxiously."
55 ""
55 "“He is a good Wizard. Whether he is a man or not I cannot tell, for I"
55 "have never seen him.”"
55 ""
55 "“How can I get there?” asked Dorothy."
55 ""
55 "“You must walk. It is a long journey, through a country that is"
55 "sometimes pleasant and sometimes dark and terrible. However, I will use"
55 "all the magic arts I know of to keep you from harm.”"
55 ""
55 "“Won’t you go with me?” pleaded the girl, who had begun to look upon"
55 "the little old woman as her only friend."
55 ""
55 "“No, I cannot do that,” she replied, “but I will give you my kiss, and"
55 "no one will dare injure a person who has been kissed by the Witch of"
55 "the North.”"
55 ""
55 "She came close to Dorothy and kissed her gently on the forehead. Where"
55 "her lips touched the girl they left a round, shining mark, as Dorothy"
55 "found out soon after."
55 ""
55 "“The road to the City of Emeralds is paved with yellow brick,” said the"
55 "Witch, “so you cannot miss it. When you get to Oz do not be afraid of"
55 "him, but tell your story and ask him to help you. Good-bye, my dear.”"
55 ""
55 "The three Munchkins bowed low to her and wished her a pleasant journey,"
55 "after which they walked away through the trees. The Witch gave Dorothy"
55 "a friendly little nod, whirled around on her left heel three times, and"
55 "straightway disappeared, much to the surprise of little Toto, who"
55 "barked after her loudly enough when she had gone, because he had been"
55 "afraid even to growl while she stood by."
55 ""
55 "But Dorothy, knowing her to be a witch, had expected her to disappear"
55 "in just that way, and was not surprised in the least."

55 "When Dorothy was left alone she began to feel hungry. So she went to"
55 "the cupboard and cut herself some bread, which she spread with butter."
55 "She gave some to Toto, and taking a pail from the shelf she carried it"
55 "down to the little brook and filled it with clear, sparkling water."
55 "Toto ran over to the trees and began to bark at the birds sitting"
55 "there. Dorothy went to get him, and saw such delicious fruit hanging"
55 "from the branches that she gathered some of it, finding it just what"
55 "she wanted to help out her breakfast."
55 ""
55 "Then she went back to the house, and having helped herself and Toto to"
55 "a good drink of the cool, clear water, she set about making ready for"
55 "the journey to the City of Emeralds."
55 ""
55 "Dorothy had only one other dress, but that happened to be clean and was"
55 "hanging on a peg beside her bed. It was gingham, with checks of white"
55 "and blue; and although the blue was somewhat faded with many washings,"
55 "it was still a pretty frock. The girl washed herself carefully, dressed"
55 "herself in the clean gingham, and tied her pink sunbonnet on her head."
55 "She took a little basket and filled it with bread from the cupboard,"
55 "laying a white cloth over the top. Then she looked down at her feet and"
55 "noticed how old and worn her shoes were."
55 ""
55 "“They surely will never do for a long journey, Toto,” she said. And"
55 "Toto looked up into her face with his little black eyes and wagged his"
55 "tail to show he knew what she meant."
55 ""
55 "At that moment Dorothy saw lying on the table the silver shoes that had"
55 "belonged to the Witch of the East."
55 ""
55 "“I wonder if they will fit me,” she said to Toto. “They would be just"
55 "the thing to take a long walk in, for they could not wear out.”"
55 ""
55 "She took off her old leather shoes and tried on the silver ones, which"
55 "fitted her as well as if they had been made for her."
55 ""
55 "Finally she picked up her basket."
55 ""
55 "“Come along, Toto,” she said. “We will go to the Emerald City and ask"
55 "the Great Oz how to get back to Kansas again.”"
55 ""
55 "She closed the door, locked it, and put the key carefully in the pocket"
55 "of her dress. And so, with Toto trotting along soberly behind her, she"
55 "started on her journey."
55 ""
55 "There were several roads nearby, but it did not take her long to find"
55 "the one paved with yellow bricks. Within a short time she was walking"
55 "briskly toward the Emerald City, her silver shoes tinkling merrily on"
55 "the hard, yellow road-bed. The sun shone bright and the birds sang"
55 "sweetly, and Dorothy did not feel nearly so bad as you might think a"
55 "little girl would who had been suddenly whisked away from her own"
55 "country and set down in the midst of a strange land."
55 ""
55 "She was surprised, as she walked along, to see how pretty the country"
55 "was about her. There were neat fences at the sides of the road, painted"
55 "a dainty blue color, and beyond them were fields of grain and"
55 "vegetables in abundance. Evidently the Munchkins were good farmers and"
55 "able to raise large crops. Once in a while she would pass a house, and"
55 "the people came out to look at her and bow low as she went by; for"
55 "everyone knew she had been the means of destroying the Wicked Witch and"
55 "setting them free from bondage. The houses of the Munchkins were"
55 "odd-looking dwellings, for each was round, with a big dome for a roof."
55 "All were painted blue, for in this country of the East blue was the"
55 "favorite color."
55 ""
55 "Toward evening, when Dorothy was tired with her long walk and began to"
55 "wonder where she should pass the night, she came to a house rather"
55 "larger than the rest. On the green lawn before it many men and women"
55 "were dancing. Five little fiddlers played as loudly as possible, and"
55 "the people were laughing and singing, while a big table near by was"
55 "loaded with delicious fruits and nuts, pies and cakes, and many other"
55 "good things to eat."
55 ""
55 "The people greeted Dorothy kindly, and invited her to supper and to"
55 "pass the night with them; for this was the home of one of the richest"
55 "Munchkins in the land, and his friends were gathered with him to"
55 "celebrate their freedom from the bondage of the Wicked Witch."
55 ""
55 "Dorothy ate a hearty supper and was waited upon by the rich Munchkin"
55 "himself, whose name was Boq. Then she sat upon a settee and watched the"
55 "people dance."
55 ""
55 "When Boq saw her silver shoes he said, “You must be a great sorceress.”"
55 ""
55 "“Why?” asked the girl."
55 ""
55 "“Because you wear silver shoes and have killed the Wicked Witch."
55 "Besides, you have white in your frock, and only witches and sorceresses"
55 "wear white.”"
55 ""
55 "“My dress is blue and white checked,” said Dorothy, smoothing out the"
55 "wrinkles in it."
55 ""
55 "“It is kind of you to wear that,” said Boq. “Blue is the color of the"
55 "Munchkins, and white is the witch color. So we know you are a friendly"
55 "witch.”"
55 ""
55 "Dorothy did not know what to say to this, for all the people seemed to"
55 "think her a witch, and she knew very well she was only an ordinary"
55 "little girl who had come by the chance of a cyclone into a strange"
55 "land."
55 ""
55 "When she had tired watching the dancing, Boq led her into the house,"
55 "where he gave her a room with a pretty bed in it. The sheets were made"
55 "of blue cloth, and Dorothy slept soundly in them till morning, with"
55 "Toto curled up on the blue rug beside her."
55 ""
55 "She ate a hearty breakfast, and watched a wee Munchkin baby, who played"
55 "with Toto and pulled his tail and crowed and laughed in a way that"
55 "greatly amused Dorothy. Toto was a fine curiosity to all the people,"
55 "for they had never seen a dog before."
55 ""
55 "“How far is it to the Emerald City?” the girl asked."
55 ""
55 "“I do not know,” answered Boq gravely, “for I have never been there. It"

55 "with him. But it is a long way to the Emerald City, and it will take"
55 "you many days. The country here is rich and pleasant, but you must pass"
55 "through rough and dangerous places before you reach the end of your"

55 ""
55 "This worried Dorothy a little, but she knew that only the Great Oz"
55 "could help her get to Kansas again, so she bravely resolved not to turn"
55 "back."
55 ""
55 "She bade her friends good-bye, and again started along the road of"
55 "yellow brick. When she had gone several miles she thought she would"
55 "stop to rest, and so climbed to the top of the fence beside the road"
55 "and sat down. There was a great cornfield beyond the fence, and not far"
55 "away she saw a Scarecrow, placed high on a pole to keep the birds from"
55 "the ripe corn."
55 ""
55 "Dorothy leaned her chin upon her hand and gazed thoughtfully at the"
55 "Scarecrow. Its head was a small sack stuffed with straw, with eyes,"
55 "nose, and mouth painted on it to represent a face. An old, pointed blue"
55 "hat, that had belonged to some Munchkin, was perched on his head, and"
55 "the rest of the figure was a blue suit of clothes, worn and faded,"
55 "which had also been stuffed with straw. On the feet were some old boots"
55 "with blue tops, such as every man wore in this country, and the figure"
55 "was raised above the stalks of corn by means of the pole stuck up its"
55 "back."
55 ""
55 "While Dorothy was looking earnestly into the queer, painted face of the"
55 "Scarecrow, she was surprised to see one of the eyes slowly wink at her."
55 "She thought she must have been mistaken at first, for none of the"
55 "scarecrows in Kansas ever wink; but presently the figure nodded its"
55 "head to her in a friendly way. Then she climbed down from the fence and"
55 "walked up to it, while Toto ran around the pole and barked."
55 ""
55 "“Good day,” said the Scarecrow, in a rather husky voice."
55 ""
55 "“Did you speak?” asked the girl, in wonder."
55 ""
55 "“Certainly,” answered the Scarecrow. “How do you do?”"
55 ""
55 "“I’m pretty well, thank you,” replied Dorothy politely. “How do you"
55 "do?”"
55 ""
55 "“I’m not feeling well,” said the Scarecrow, with a smile, “for it is"
55 "very tedious being perched up here night and day to scare away crows.”"
55 ""
55 "“Can’t you get down?” asked Dorothy."
55 ""
55 "“No, for this pole is stuck up my back. If you will please take away"
55 "the pole I shall be greatly obliged to you.”"
55 ""
55 "Dorothy reached up both arms and lifted the figure off the pole, for,"
55 "being stuffed with straw, it was quite light."
55 ""
55 "“Thank you very much,” said the Scarecrow, when he had been set down on"
55 "the ground. “I feel like a new man.”"
55 ""
55 "Dorothy was puzzled at this, for it sounded queer to hear a stuffed man"
55 "speak, and to see him bow and walk along beside her."
55 ""
55 "“Who are you?” asked the Scarecrow when he had stretched himself and"
55 "yawned. “And where are you going?”"
55 ""
55 "“My name is Dorothy,” said the girl, “and I am going to the Emerald"
55 "City, to ask the Great Oz to send me back to Kansas.”"
55 ""
55 "“Where is the Emerald City?” he inquired. “And who is Oz?”"
55 ""
55 "“Why, don’t you know?” she returned, in surprise."
55 ""
55 "“No, indeed. I don’t know anything. You see, I am stuffed, so I have no"
55 "brains at all,” he answered sadly."
55 ""
55 "“Oh,” said Dorothy, “I’m awfully sorry for you.”"
55 ""
55 "“Do you think,” he asked, “if I go to the Emerald City with you, that"
55 "Oz would give me some brains?”"
55 ""
55 "“I cannot tell,” she returned, “but you may come with me, if you like."
55 "If Oz will not give you any brains you will be no worse off than you"
55 "are now.”"
55 ""
55 "“That is true,” said the Scarecrow. “You see,” he continued"
55 "confidentially, “I don’t mind my legs and arms and body being stuffed,"
55 "because I cannot get hurt. If anyone treads on my toes or sticks a pin"
55 "into me, it doesn’t matter, for I can’t feel it. But I do not want"
55 "people to call me a fool, and if my head stays stuffed with straw"
55 "instead of with brains, as yours is, how am I ever to know anything?”"
55 ""
55 "“I understand how you feel,” said the little girl, who was truly sorry"
55 "for him. “If you will come with me I’ll ask Oz to do all he can for"
55 "you.”"
55 ""
55 "“Thank you,” he answered gratefully."
55 ""
55 "They walked back to the road. Dorothy helped him over the fence, and"
55 "they started along the path of yellow brick for the Emerald City."
55 ""
55 "Toto did not like this addition to the party at first. He smelled"
55 "around the stuffed man as if he suspected there might be a nest of rats"
55 "in the straw, and he often growled in an unfriendly way at the"
55 "Scarecrow."
55 ""
55 "“Don’t mind Toto,” said Dorothy to her new friend. “He never bites.”"

55 "“Oh, I’m not afraid,” replied the Scarecrow. “He can’t hurt the straw."

55 "“There is only one thing in the world I am afraid of.”"

55 "difficult that the Scarecrow often stumbled over the yellow bricks,"
55 "which were here very uneven. Sometimes, indeed, they were broken or"

55 "walked around. As for the Scarecrow, having no brains, he walked"
55 "straight ahead, and so stepped into the holes and fell at full length"

55 "At noon they sat down by the roadside, near a little brook, and Dorothy"
55 "opened her basket and got out some bread. She offered a piece to the"

55 "“I am never hungry,” he said, “and it is a lucky thing I am not, for my"

55 "Dorothy saw at once that this was true, so she only nodded and went on"
55 "eating her bread."
55 ""
55 "“Tell me something about yourself and the country you came from,” said"
55 "the Scarecrow, when she had finished her dinner. So she told him all"
55 "about Kansas, and how gray everything was there, and how the cyclone"
55 "had carried her to this queer Land of Oz."
55 ""
55 "The Scarecrow listened carefully, and said, “I cannot understand why"
55 "you should wish to leave this beautiful country and go back to the dry,"
55 "gray place you call Kansas.”"
55 ""
55 "“That is because you have no brains” answered the girl. “No matter how"
55 "dreary and gray our homes are, we people of flesh and blood would"
55 "rather live there than in any other country, be it ever so beautiful."
55 "There is no place like home.”"
55 ""
55 "The Scarecrow sighed."
55 ""
55 "“Of course I cannot understand it,” he said. “If your heads were"
55 "stuffed with straw, like mine, you would probably all live in the"
55 "beautiful places, and then Kansas would have no people at all. It is"
55 "fortunate for Kansas that you have brains.”"
55 ""
55 "“Won’t you tell me a story, while we are resting?” asked the child."
55 ""
55 "The Scarecrow looked at her reproachfully, and answered:"
55 ""
55 "“My life has been so short that I really know nothing whatever. I was"
55 "only made day before yesterday. What happened in the world before that"
55 "time is all unknown to me. Luckily, when the farmer made my head, one"
55 "of the first things he did was to paint my ears, so that I heard what"
55 "was going on. There was another Munchkin with him, and the first thing"
55 "I heard was the farmer saying, ‘How do you like those ears?’"
55 ""
55 "“‘They aren’t straight,’” answered the other."
55 ""
55 "“‘Never mind,’” said the farmer. “‘They are ears just the same,’” which"
55 "was true enough."
55 ""
55 "“‘Now I’ll make the eyes,’” said the farmer. So he painted my right"
55 "eye, and as soon as it was finished I found myself looking at him and"
55 "at everything around me with a great deal of curiosity, for this was my"
55 "first glimpse of the world."
55 ""
55 "“‘That’s a rather pretty eye,’” remarked the Munchkin who was watching"
55 "the farmer. “‘Blue paint is just the color for eyes.’"
55 ""
55 "“‘I think I’ll make the other a little bigger,’” said the farmer. And"
55 "when the second eye was done I could see much better than before. Then"
55 "he made my nose and my mouth. But I did not speak, because at that time"
55 "I didn’t know what a mouth was for. I had the fun of watching them make"
55 "my body and my arms and legs; and when they fastened on my head, at"
55 "last, I felt very proud, for I thought I was just as good a man as"
55 "anyone."
55 ""
55 "“‘This fellow will scare the crows fast enough,’ said the farmer. ‘He"
55 "looks just like a man.’"
55 ""
55 "“‘Why, he is a man,’ said the other, and I quite agreed with him. The"
55 "farmer carried me under his arm to the cornfield, and set me up on a"
55 "tall stick, where you found me. He and his friend soon after walked"
55 "away and left me alone."
55 ""
55 "“I did not like to be deserted this way. So I tried to walk after them."
55 "But my feet would not touch the ground, and I was forced to stay on"
55 "that pole. It was a lonely life to lead, for I had nothing to think of,"
55 "having been made such a little while before. Many crows and other birds"
55 "flew into the cornfield, but as soon as they saw me they flew away"
55 "again, thinking I was a Munchkin; and this pleased me and made me feel"
55 "that I was quite an important person. By and by an old crow flew near"
55 "me, and after looking at me carefully he perched upon my shoulder and"
55 "said:"
55 ""
55 "“‘I wonder if that farmer thought to fool me in this clumsy manner. Any"
55 "crow of sense could see that you are only stuffed with straw.’ Then he"
55 "hopped down at my feet and ate all the corn he wanted. The other birds,"
55 "seeing he was not harmed by me, came to eat the corn too, so in a short"
55 "time there was a great flock of them about me."
55 ""
55 "“I felt sad at this, for it showed I was not such a good Scarecrow"
55 "after all; but the old crow comforted me, saying, ‘If you only had"
55 "brains in your head you would be as good a man as any of them, and a"
55 "better man than some of them. Brains are the only things worth having"
55 "in this world, no matter whether one is a crow or a man.’"
55 ""
55 "“After the crows had gone I thought this over, and decided I would try"
55 "hard to get some brains. By good luck you came along and pulled me off"
55 "the stake, and from what you say I am sure the Great Oz will give me"
55 "brains as soon as we get to the Emerald City.”"
55 ""
55 "“I hope so,” said Dorothy earnestly, “since you seem anxious to have"
55 "them.”"
55 ""
55 "“Oh, yes; I am anxious,” returned the Scarecrow. “It is such an"
55 "uncomfortable feeling to know one is a fool.”"
55 ""
55 "“Well,” said the girl, “let us go.” And she handed the basket to the"
55 "Scarecrow."
55 ""
55 "There were no fences at all by the roadside now, and the land was rough"
55 "and untilled. Toward evening they came to a great forest, where the"
55 "trees grew so big and close together that their branches met over the"
55 "road of yellow brick. It was almost dark under the trees, for the"
55 "branches shut out the daylight; but the travelers did not stop, and"
55 "went on into the forest."
55 ""
55 "“If this road goes in, it must come out,” said the Scarecrow, “and as"
55 "the Emerald City is at the other end of the road, we must go wherever"
55 "it leads us.”"
55 ""
55 "“Anyone would know that,” said Dorothy."
55 ""
55 "“Certainly; that is why I know it,” returned the Scarecrow. “If it"
55 "required brains to figure it out, I never should have said it.”"
55 ""
55 "After an hour or so the light faded away, and they found themselves"
55 "stumbling along in the darkness. Dorothy could not see at all, but Toto"
55 "could, for some dogs see very well in the dark; and the Scarecrow"
55 "declared he could see as well as by day. So she took hold of his arm"
55 "and managed to get along fairly well."
55 ""
55 "“If you see any house, or any place where we can pass the night,” she"
55 "said, “you must tell me; for it is very uncomfortable walking in the"
55 "dark.”"
55 ""
55 "Soon after the Scarecrow stopped."
55 ""
55 "“I see a little cottage at the right of us,” he said, “built of logs"
55 "and branches. Shall we go there?”"
55 ""
55 "“Yes, indeed,” answered the child. “I am all tired out.”"
55 ""
55 "So the Scarecrow led her through the trees until they reached the"
55 "cottage, and Dorothy entered and found a bed of dried leaves in one"
55 "corner. She lay down at once, and with Toto beside her soon fell into a"
55 "sound sleep. The Scarecrow, who was never tired, stood up in another"

55 ""
55 "“We must go and search for water,” she said to him."

55 ""
55 "They left the cottage and walked through the trees until they found a"

55 "the girl was thankful the Scarecrow did not have to eat anything, for"
55 "there was scarcely enough for herself and Toto for the day."
55 ""
55 "When she had finished her meal, and was about to go back to the road of"
55 "yellow brick, she was startled to hear a deep groan near by."

55 "“What was that?” she asked timidly."
55 ""
55 "“I cannot imagine,” replied the Scarecrow; “but we can go and see.”"
55 ""
55 "Just then another groan reached their ears, and the sound seemed to"
55 "come from behind them. They turned and walked through the forest a few"
55 "steps, when Dorothy discovered something shining in a ray of sunshine"
55 "that fell between the trees. She ran to the place and then stopped"
55 "short, with a little cry of surprise."
55 ""
55 "One of the big trees had been partly chopped through, and standing"
55 "beside it, with an uplifted axe in his hands, was a man made entirely"
55 "of tin. His head and arms and legs were jointed upon his body, but he"
55 "stood perfectly motionless, as if he could not stir at all."
55 ""
55 "Dorothy looked at him in amazement, and so did the Scarecrow, while"
55 "Toto barked sharply and made a snap at the tin legs, which hurt his"
55 "teeth."
55 ""
55 "“Did you groan?” asked Dorothy."
55 ""
55 "“Yes,” answered the tin man, “I did. I’ve been groaning for more than a"
55 "year, and no one has ever heard me before or come to help me.”"
55 ""
55 "“What can I do for you?” she inquired softly, for she was moved by the"
55 "sad voice in which the man spoke."
55 ""
55 "“Get an oil-can and oil my joints,” he answered. “They are rusted so"
55 "badly that I cannot move them at all; if I am well oiled I shall soon"
55 "be all right again. You will find an oil-can on a shelf in my cottage.”"
55 ""

55 ""
55 "“Oil my neck, first,” replied the Tin Woodman. So she oiled it, and as"
55 "it was quite badly rusted the Scarecrow took hold of the tin head and"
55 "moved it gently from side to side until it worked freely, and then the"
55 "man could turn it himself."
55 ""
55 "“Now oil the joints in my arms,” he said. And Dorothy oiled them and"
55 "the Scarecrow bent them carefully until they were quite free from rust"
55 "and as good as new."
55 ""
55 "The Tin Woodman gave a sigh of satisfaction and lowered his axe, which"
55 "he leaned against the tree."
55 ""
55 "“This is a great comfort,” he said. “I have been holding that axe in"
55 "the air ever since I rusted, and I’m glad to be able to put it down at"
55 "last. Now, if you will oil the joints of my legs, I shall be all right"
55 "once more.”"
55 ""
55 "So they oiled his legs until he could move them freely; and he thanked"

55 ""
55 "“No, my head is quite empty,” answered the Woodman. “But once I had"

55 ""
55 "“I will tell you my story, and then you will know.”"
55 ""
55 "So, while they were walking through the forest, the Tin Woodman told"
55 "the following story:"
55 ""
55 "“I was born the son of a woodman who chopped down trees in the forest"
55 "and sold the wood for a living. When I grew up, I too became a"
55 "woodchopper, and after my father died I took care of my old mother as"
55 "long as she lived. Then I made up my mind that instead of living alone"
55 "I would marry, so that I might not become lonely."
55 ""
55 "“There was one of the Munchkin girls who was so beautiful that I soon"
55 "grew to love her with all my heart. She, on her part, promised to marry"
55 "me as soon as I could earn enough money to build a better house for"
55 "her; so I set to work harder than ever. But the girl lived with an old"
55 "woman who did not want her to marry anyone, for she was so lazy she"
55 "wished the girl to remain with her and do the cooking and the"
55 "housework. So the old woman went to the Wicked Witch of the East, and"
55 "promised her two sheep and a cow if she would prevent the marriage."
55 "Thereupon the Wicked Witch enchanted my axe, and when I was chopping"
55 "away at my best one day, for I was anxious to get the new house and my"
55 "wife as soon as possible, the axe slipped all at once and cut off my"
55 "left leg."
55 ""
55 "“This at first seemed a great misfortune, for I knew a one-legged man"
55 "could not do very well as a wood-chopper. So I went to a tinsmith and"
55 "had him make me a new leg out of tin. The leg worked very well, once I"
55 "was used to it. But my action angered the Wicked Witch of the East, for"
55 "she had promised the old woman I should not marry the pretty Munchkin"
55 "girl. When I began chopping again, my axe slipped and cut off my right"
55 "leg. Again I went to the tinsmith, and again he made me a leg out of"
55 "tin. After this the enchanted axe cut off my arms, one after the other;"
55 "but, nothing daunted, I had them replaced with tin ones. The Wicked"
55 "Witch then made the axe slip and cut off my head, and at first I"
55 "thought that was the end of me. But the tinsmith happened to come"
55 "along, and he made me a new head out of tin."
55 ""
55 "“I thought I had beaten the Wicked Witch then, and I worked harder than"
55 "ever; but I little knew how cruel my enemy could be. She thought of a"
55 "new way to kill my love for the beautiful Munchkin maiden, and made my"
55 "axe slip again, so that it cut right through my body, splitting me into"
55 "two halves. Once more the tinsmith came to my help and made me a body"
55 "of tin, fastening my tin arms and legs and head to it, by means of"
55 "joints, so that I could move around as well as ever. But, alas! I had"
55 "now no heart, so that I lost all my love for the Munchkin girl, and did"
55 "not care whether I married her or not. I suppose she is still living"
55 "with the old woman, waiting for me to come after her."
55 ""
55 "“My body shone so brightly in the sun that I felt very proud of it and"
55 "it did not matter now if my axe slipped, for it could not cut me. There"
55 "was only one danger—that my joints would rust; but I kept an oil-can in"
55 "my cottage and took care to oil myself whenever I needed it. However,"
55 "there came a day when I forgot to do this, and, being caught in a"

55 "was left to stand in the woods until you came to help me. It was a"
55 "terrible thing to undergo, but during the year I stood there I had time"
55 "to think that the greatest loss I had known was the loss of my heart."
55 "While I was in love I was the happiest man on earth; but no one can"
55 "love who has not a heart, and so I am resolved to ask Oz to give me"
55 "one. If he does, I will go back to the Munchkin maiden and marry her.”"
55 ""
55 "Both Dorothy and the Scarecrow had been greatly interested in the story"
55 "of the Tin Woodman, and now they knew why he was so anxious to get a"
55 "new heart."
55 ""
55 "“All the same,” said the Scarecrow, “I shall ask for brains instead of"
55 "a heart; for a fool would not know what to do with a heart if he had"
55 "one.”"
55 ""
55 "“I shall take the heart,” returned the Tin Woodman; “for brains do not"
55 "make one happy, and happiness is the best thing in the world.”"
55 ""
55 "Dorothy did not say anything, for she was puzzled to know which of her"
55 "two friends was right, and she decided if she could only get back to"
55 "Kansas and Aunt Em, it did not matter so much whether the Woodman had"
55 "no brains and the Scarecrow no heart, or each got what he wanted."
55 ""
55 "What worried her most was that the bread was nearly gone, and another"
55 "meal for herself and Toto would empty the basket. To be sure, neither"
55 "the Woodman nor the Scarecrow ever ate anything, but she was not made"
55 "of tin nor straw, and could not live unless she was fed."

55 "much covered by dried branches and dead leaves from the trees, and the"
55 "walking was not at all good."
55 ""
55 "There were few birds in this part of the forest, for birds love the"
55 "open country where there is plenty of sunshine. But now and then there"
55 "came a deep growl from some wild animal hidden among the trees. These"
55 "sounds made the little girl’s heart beat fast, for she did not know"
55 "what made them; but Toto knew, and he walked close to Dorothy’s side,"
55 "and did not even bark in return."
55 ""
55 "“How long will it be,” the child asked of the Tin Woodman, “before we"
55 "are out of the forest?”"
55 ""
55 "“I cannot tell,” was the answer, “for I have never been to the Emerald"
55 "City. But my father went there once, when I was a boy, and he said it"
55 "was a long journey through a dangerous country, although nearer to the"
55 "city where Oz dwells the country is beautiful. But I am not afraid so"
55 "long as I have my oil-can, and nothing can hurt the Scarecrow, while"
55 "you bear upon your forehead the mark of the Good Witch’s kiss, and that"
55 "will protect you from harm.”"
55 ""
55 "“But Toto!” said the girl anxiously. “What will protect him?”"
55 ""
55 "“We must protect him ourselves if he is in danger,” replied the Tin"
55 "Woodman."
55 ""
55 "Just as he spoke there came from the forest a terrible roar, and the"
55 "next moment a great Lion bounded into the road. With one blow of his"
55 "paw he sent the Scarecrow spinning over and over to the edge of the"
55 "road, and then he struck at the Tin Woodman with his sharp claws. But,"
55 "to the Lion’s surprise, he could make no impression on the tin,"
55 "although the Woodman fell over in the road and lay still."
55 ""
55 "Little Toto, now that he had an enemy to face, ran barking toward the"
55 "Lion, and the great beast had opened his mouth to bite the dog, when"
55 "Dorothy, fearing Toto would be killed, and heedless of danger, rushed"
55 "forward and slapped the Lion upon his nose as hard as she could, while"
55 "she cried out:"
55 ""
55 "“Don’t you dare to bite Toto! You ought to be ashamed of yourself, a"
55 "big beast like you, to bite a poor little dog!”"
55 ""
55 "“I didn’t bite him,” said the Lion, as he rubbed his nose with his paw"
55 "where Dorothy had hit it."
55 ""
55 "“No, but you tried to,” she retorted. “You are nothing but a big"
55 "coward.”"
55 ""
55 "“I know it,” said the Lion, hanging his head in shame. “I’ve always"
55 "known it. But how can I help it?”"
55 ""
55 "“I don’t know, I’m sure. To think of your striking a stuffed man, like"
55 "the poor Scarecrow!”"
55 ""
55 "“Is he stuffed?” asked the Lion in surprise, as he watched her pick up"
55 "the Scarecrow and set him upon his feet, while she patted him into"
55 "shape again."
55 ""
55 "“Of course he’s stuffed,” replied Dorothy, who was still angry."
55 ""
55 "“That’s why he went over so easily,” remarked the Lion. “It astonished"
55 "me to see him whirl around so. Is the other one stuffed also?”"
55 ""
55 "“No,” said Dorothy, “he’s made of tin.” And she helped the Woodman up"
55 "again."
55 ""
55 "“That’s why he nearly blunted my claws,” said the Lion. “When they"
55 "scratched against the tin it made a cold shiver run down my back. What"
55 "is that little animal you are so tender of?”"
55 ""
55 "“He is my dog, Toto,” answered Dorothy."
55 ""
55 "“Is he made of tin, or stuffed?” asked the Lion."
55 ""
55 "“Neither. He’s a—a—a meat dog,” said the girl."
55 ""
55 "“Oh! He’s a curious animal and seems remarkably small, now that I look"
55 "at him. No one would think of biting such a little thing, except a"
55 "coward like me,” continued the Lion sadly."
55 ""
55 "“What makes you a coward?” asked Dorothy, looking at the great beast in"
55 "wonder, for he was as big as a small horse."
55 ""
55 "“It’s a mystery,” replied the Lion. “I suppose I was born that way. All"
55 "the other animals in the forest naturally expect me to be brave, for"
55 "the Lion is everywhere thought to be the King of Beasts. I learned that"
55 "if I roared very loudly every living thing was frightened and got out"
55 "of my way. Whenever I’ve met a man I’ve been awfully scared; but I just"
55 "roared at him, and he has always run away as fast as he could go. If"
55 "the elephants and the tigers and the bears had ever tried to fight me,"
55 "I should have run myself—I’m such a coward; but just as soon as they"
55 "hear me roar they all try to get away from me, and of course I let them"
55 "go.”"
55 ""
55 "“But that isn’t right. The King of Beasts shouldn’t be a coward,” said"
55 "the Scarecrow."
55 ""
55 "“I know it,” returned the Lion, wiping a tear from his eye with the tip"
55 "of his tail. “It is my great sorrow, and makes my life very unhappy."
55 "But whenever there is danger, my heart begins to beat fast.”"
55 ""
55 "“Perhaps you have heart disease,” said the Tin Woodman."
55 ""
55 "“It may be,” said the Lion."
55 ""
55 "“If you have,” continued the Tin Woodman, “you ought to be glad, for it"
55 "proves you have a heart. For my part, I have no heart; so I cannot have"
55 "heart disease.”"
55 ""
55 "“Perhaps,” said the Lion thoughtfully, “if I had no heart I should not"
55 "be a coward.”"
55 ""
55 "“Have you brains?” asked the Scarecrow."
55 ""
55 "“I suppose so. I’ve never looked to see,” replied the Lion."
55 ""
55 "“I am going to the Great Oz to ask him to give me some,” remarked the"
55 "Scarecrow, “for my head is stuffed with straw.”"
55 ""
55 "“And I am going to ask him to give me a heart,” said the Woodman."
55 ""
55 "“And I am going to ask him to send Toto and me back to Kansas,” added"
55 "Dorothy."
55 ""
55 "“Do you think Oz could give me courage?” asked the Cowardly Lion."
55 ""
55 "“Just as easily as he could give me brains,” said the Scarecrow."
55 ""
55 "“Or give me a heart,” said the Tin Woodman."
55 ""
55 "“Or send me back to Kansas,” said Dorothy."
55 ""
55 "“Then, if you don’t mind, I’ll go with you,” said the Lion, “for my"
55 "life is simply unbearable without a bit of courage.”"
55 ""
55 "“You will be very welcome,” answered Dorothy, “for you will help to"
55 "keep away the other wild beasts. It seems to me they must be more"
55 "cowardly than you are if they allow you to scare them so easily.”"
55 ""
55 "“They really are,” said the Lion, “but that doesn’t make me any braver,"
55 "and as long as I know myself to be a coward I shall be unhappy.”"
55 ""
55 "So once more the little company set off upon the journey, the Lion"
55 "walking with stately strides at Dorothy’s side. Toto did not approve of"
55 "this new comrade at first, for he could not forget how nearly he had"
55 "been crushed between the Lion’s great jaws. But after a time he became"
55 "more at ease, and presently Toto and the Cowardly Lion had grown to be"
55 "good friends."
55 ""
55 "During the rest of that day there was no other adventure to mar the"
55 "peace of their journey. Once, indeed, the Tin Woodman stepped upon a"
55 "beetle that was crawling along the road, and killed the poor little"
55 "thing. This made the Tin Woodman very unhappy, for he was always"
55 "careful not to hurt any living creature; and as he walked along he wept"
55 "several tears of sorrow and regret. These tears ran slowly down his"
55 "face and over the hinges of his jaw, and there they rusted. When"
55 "Dorothy presently asked him a question the Tin Woodman could not open"
55 "his mouth, for his jaws were tightly rusted together. He became greatly"
55 "frightened at this and made many motions to Dorothy to relieve him, but"
55 "she could not understand. The Lion was also puzzled to know what was"
55 "wrong. But the Scarecrow seized the oil-can from Dorothy’s basket and"
55 "oiled the Woodman’s jaws, so that after a few moments he could talk as"
55 "well as before."
55 ""
55 "“This will serve me a lesson,” said he, “to look where I step. For if I"
55 "should kill another bug or beetle I should surely cry again, and crying"
55 "rusts my jaws so that I cannot speak.”"
55 ""
55 "Thereafter he walked very carefully, with his eyes on the road, and"
55 "when he saw a tiny ant toiling by he would step over it, so as not to"
55 "harm it. The Tin Woodman knew very well he had no heart, and therefore"
55 "he took great care never to be cruel or unkind to anything."
55 ""
55 "“You people with hearts,” he said, “have something to guide you, and"
55 "need never do wrong; but I have no heart, and so I must be very"
55 "careful. When Oz gives me a heart of course I needn’t mind so much.”"

55 ""
55 "They were obliged to camp out that night under a large tree in the"
55 "forest, for there were no houses near. The tree made a good, thick"
55 "covering to protect them from the dew, and the Tin Woodman chopped a"
55 "great pile of wood with his axe and Dorothy built a splendid fire that"
55 "warmed her and made her feel less lonely. She and Toto ate the last of"
55 "their bread, and now she did not know what they would do for breakfast."
55 ""
55 "“If you wish,” said the Lion, “I will go into the forest and kill a"
55 "deer for you. You can roast it by the fire, since your tastes are so"
55 "peculiar that you prefer cooked food, and then you will have a very"
55 "good breakfast.”"
55 ""
55 "“Don’t! Please don’t,” begged the Tin Woodman. “I should certainly weep"

55 ""
55 "But the Lion went away into the forest and found his own supper, and no"
55 "one ever knew what it was, for he didn’t mention it. And the Scarecrow"
55 "found a tree full of nuts and filled Dorothy’s basket with them, so"
55 "that she would not be hungry for a long time. She thought this was very"
55 "kind and thoughtful of the Scarecrow, but she laughed heartily at the"
55 "awkward way in which the poor creature picked up the nuts. His padded"
55 "hands were so clumsy and the nuts were so small that he dropped almost"
55 "as many as he put in the basket. But the Scarecrow did not mind how"
55 "long it took him to fill the basket, for it enabled him to keep away"
55 "from the fire, as he feared a spark might get into his straw and burn"
55 "him up. So he kept a good distance away from the flames, and only came"
55 "near to cover Dorothy with dry leaves when she lay down to sleep. These"
55 "kept her very snug and warm, and she slept soundly until morning."
55 ""
55 "When it was daylight, the girl bathed her face in a little rippling"
55 "brook, and soon after they all started toward the Emerald City."
55 ""
55 "This was to be an eventful day for the travelers. They had hardly been"
55 "walking an hour when they saw before them a great ditch that crossed"
55 "the road and divided the forest as far as they could see on either"
55 "side. It was a very wide ditch, and when they crept up to the edge and"
55 "looked into it they could see it was also very deep, and there were"
55 "many big, jagged rocks at the bottom. The sides were so steep that none"
55 "of them could climb down, and for a moment it seemed that their journey"
55 "must end."
55 ""
55 "“What shall we do?” asked Dorothy despairingly."
55 ""
55 "“I haven’t the faintest idea,” said the Tin Woodman, and the Lion shook"
55 "his shaggy mane and looked thoughtful."
55 ""
55 "But the Scarecrow said, “We cannot fly, that is certain. Neither can we"
55 "climb down into this great ditch. Therefore, if we cannot jump over it,"
55 "we must stop where we are.”"
55 ""
55 "“I think I could jump over it,” said the Cowardly Lion, after measuring"
55 "the distance carefully in his mind."
55 ""
55 "“Then we are all right,” answered the Scarecrow, “for you can carry us"
55 "all over on your back, one at a time.”"
55 ""
55 "“Well, I’ll try it,” said the Lion. “Who will go first?”"
55 ""
55 "“I will,” declared the Scarecrow, “for, if you found that you could not"
55 "jump over the gulf, Dorothy would be killed, or the Tin Woodman badly"
55 "dented on the rocks below. But if I am on your back it will not matter"
55 "so much, for the fall would not hurt me at all.”"
55 ""
55 "“I am terribly afraid of falling, myself,” said the Cowardly Lion, “but"
55 "I suppose there is nothing to do but try it. So get on my back and we"
55 "will make the attempt.”"
55 ""
55 "The Scarecrow sat upon the Lion’s back, and the big beast walked to the"
55 "edge of the gulf and crouched down."
55 ""
55 "“Why don’t you run and jump?” asked the Scarecrow."
55 ""
55 "“Because that isn’t the way we Lions do these things,” he replied. Then"
55 "giving a great spring, he shot through the air and landed safely on the"
55 "other side. They were all greatly pleased to see how easily he did it,"
55 "and after the Scarecrow had got down from his back the Lion sprang"
55 "across the ditch again."
55 ""
55 "Dorothy thought she would go next; so she took Toto in her arms and"
55 "climbed on the Lion’s back, holding tightly to his mane with one hand."
55 "The next moment it seemed as if she were flying through the air; and"
55 "then, before she had time to think about it, she was safe on the other"
55 "side. The Lion went back a third time and got the Tin Woodman, and then"
55 "they all sat down for a few moments to give the beast a chance to rest,"
55 "for his great leaps had made his breath short, and he panted like a big"
55 "dog that has been running too long."
55 ""
55 "They found the forest very thick on this side, and it looked dark and"
55 "gloomy. After the Lion had rested they started along the road of yellow"
55 "brick, silently wondering, each in his own mind, if ever they would"
55 "come to the end of the woods and reach the bright sunshine again. To"
55 "add to their discomfort, they soon heard strange noises in the depths"
55 "of the forest, and the Lion whispered to them that it was in this part"
55 "of the country that the Kalidahs lived."
55 ""
55 "“What are the Kalidahs?” asked the girl."
55 ""
55 "“They are monstrous beasts with bodies like bears and heads like"
55 "tigers,” replied the Lion, “and with claws so long and sharp that they"
55 "could tear me in two as easily as I could kill Toto. I’m terribly"
55 "afraid of the Kalidahs.”"
55 ""
55 "“I’m not surprised that you are,” returned Dorothy. “They must be"
55 "dreadful beasts.”"
55 ""
55 "The Lion was about to reply when suddenly they came to another gulf"
55 "across the road. But this one was so broad and deep that the Lion knew"
55 "at once he could not leap across it."
55 ""
55 "So they sat down to consider what they should do, and after serious"
55 "thought the Scarecrow said:"
55 ""
55 "“Here is a great tree, standing close to the ditch. If the Tin Woodman"
55 "can chop it down, so that it will fall to the other side, we can walk"
55 "across it easily.”"
55 ""
55 "“That is a first-rate idea,” said the Lion. “One would almost suspect"
55 "you had brains in your head, instead of straw.”"
55 ""
55 "The Woodman set to work at once, and so sharp was his axe that the tree"
55 "was soon chopped nearly through. Then the Lion put his strong front"
55 "legs against the tree and pushed with all his might, and slowly the big"
55 "tree tipped and fell with a crash across the ditch, with its top"
55 "branches on the other side."
55 ""
55 "They had just started to cross this queer bridge when a sharp growl"
55 "made them all look up, and to their horror they saw running toward them"
55 "two great beasts with bodies like bears and heads like tigers."
55 ""
55 "“They are the Kalidahs!” said the Cowardly Lion, beginning to tremble."
55 ""
55 "“Quick!” cried the Scarecrow. “Let us cross over.”"
55 ""
55 "So Dorothy went first, holding Toto in her arms, the Tin Woodman"
55 "followed, and the Scarecrow came next. The Lion, although he was"
55 "certainly afraid, turned to face the Kalidahs, and then he gave so loud"
55 "and terrible a roar that Dorothy screamed and the Scarecrow fell over"
55 "backward, while even the fierce beasts stopped short and looked at him"
55 "in surprise."
55 ""
55 "But, seeing they were bigger than the Lion, and remembering that there"
55 "were two of them and only one of him, the Kalidahs again rushed"
55 "forward, and the Lion crossed over the tree and turned to see what they"
55 "would do next. Without stopping an instant the fierce beasts also began"
55 "to cross the tree. And the Lion said to Dorothy:"
55 ""
55 "“We are lost, for they will surely tear us to pieces with their sharp"
55 "claws. But stand close behind me, and I will fight them as long as I am"
55 "alive.”"
55 ""
55 "“Wait a minute!” called the Scarecrow. He had been thinking what was"
55 "best to be done, and now he asked the Woodman to chop away the end of"
55 "the tree that rested on their side of the ditch. The Tin Woodman began"
55 "to use his axe at once, and, just as the two Kalidahs were nearly"
55 "across, the tree fell with a crash into the gulf, carrying the ugly,"
55 "snarling brutes with it, and both were dashed to pieces on the sharp"
55 "rocks at the bottom."
55 ""
55 "“Well,” said the Cowardly Lion, drawing a long breath of relief, “I see"
55 "we are going to live a little while longer, and I am glad of it, for it"
55 "must be a very uncomfortable thing not to be alive. Those creatures"
55 "frightened me so badly that my heart is beating yet.”"
55 ""
55 "“Ah,” said the Tin Woodman sadly, “I wish I had a heart to beat.”"
55 ""
55 "This adventure made the travelers more anxious than ever to get out of"
55 "the forest, and they walked so fast that Dorothy became tired, and had"
55 "to ride on the Lion’s back. To their great joy the trees became thinner"
55 "the farther they advanced, and in the afternoon they suddenly came upon"
55 "a broad river, flowing swiftly just before them. On the other side of"
55 "the water they could see the road of yellow brick running through a"
55 "beautiful country, with green meadows dotted with bright flowers and"
55 "all the road bordered with trees hanging full of delicious fruits. They"
55 "were greatly pleased to see this delightful country before them."
55 ""
55 "“How shall we cross the river?” asked Dorothy."
55 ""
55 "“That is easily done,” replied the Scarecrow. “The Tin Woodman must"
55 "build us a raft, so we can float to the other side.”"
55 ""
55 "So the Woodman took his axe and began to chop down small trees to make"
55 "a raft, and while he was busy at this the Scarecrow found on the"
55 "riverbank a tree full of fine fruit. This pleased Dorothy, who had"
55 "eaten nothing but nuts all day, and she made a hearty meal of the ripe"
55 "fruit."
55 ""
55 "But it takes time to make a raft, even when one is as industrious and"
55 "untiring as the Tin Woodman, and when night came the work was not done."
55 "So they found a cozy place under the trees where they slept well until"
55 "the morning; and Dorothy dreamed of the Emerald City, and of the good"
55 "Wizard Oz, who would soon send her back to her own home again."

55 "<Chapter VIII"
55 "The Deadly Poppy Field>"

55 ""
55 "Our little party of travelers awakened the next morning refreshed and"
55 "full of hope, and Dorothy breakfasted like a princess off peaches and"
55 "plums from the trees beside the river. Behind them was the dark forest"
55 "they had passed safely through, although they had suffered many"
55 "discouragements; but before them was a lovely, sunny country that"
55 "seemed to beckon them on to the Emerald City."
55 ""
55 "To be sure, the broad river now cut them off from this beautiful land."
55 "But the raft was nearly done, and after the Tin Woodman had cut a few"
55 "more logs and fastened them together with wooden pins, they were ready"
55 "to start. Dorothy sat down in the middle of the raft and held Toto in"
55 "her arms. When the Cowardly Lion stepped upon the raft it tipped badly,"
55 "for he was big and heavy; but the Scarecrow and the Tin Woodman stood"
55 "upon the other end to steady it, and they had long poles in their hands"
55 "to push the raft through the water."
55 ""
55 "They got along quite well at first, but when they reached the middle of"
55 "the river the swift current swept the raft downstream, farther and"
55 "farther away from the road of yellow brick. And the water grew so deep"
55 "that the long poles would not touch the bottom."
55 ""
55 "“This is bad,” said the Tin Woodman, “for if we cannot get to the land"
55 "we shall be carried into the country of the Wicked Witch of the West,"
55 "and she will enchant us and make us her slaves.”"

55 ""
55 "“We must certainly get to the Emerald City if we can,” the Scarecrow"
55 "continued, and he pushed so hard on his long pole that it stuck fast in"
55 "the mud at the bottom of the river. Then, before he could pull it out"
55 "again—or let go—the raft was swept away, and the poor Scarecrow was"
55 "left clinging to the pole in the middle of the river."
55 ""
55 "“Good-bye!” he called after them, and they were very sorry to leave"
55 "him. Indeed, the Tin Woodman began to cry, but fortunately remembered"
55 "that he might rust, and so dried his tears on Dorothy’s apron."
55 ""
55 "Of course this was a bad thing for the Scarecrow."
55 ""
55 "“I am now worse off than when I first met Dorothy,” he thought. “Then,"
55 "I was stuck on a pole in a cornfield, where I could make-believe scare"
55 "the crows, at any rate. But surely there is no use for a Scarecrow"
55 "stuck on a pole in the middle of a river. I am afraid I shall never"
55 "have any brains, after all!”"

55 "Down the stream the raft floated, and the poor Scarecrow was left far"
55 "behind. Then the Lion said:"

55 "So he sprang into the water, and the Tin Woodman caught fast hold of"
55 "his tail. Then the Lion began to swim with all his might toward the"
55 "shore. It was hard work, although he was so big; but by and by they"
55 "were drawn out of the current, and then Dorothy took the Tin Woodman’s"
55 "long pole and helped push the raft to the land."
55 ""
55 "They were all tired out when they reached the shore at last and stepped"
55 "off upon the pretty green grass, and they also knew that the stream had"
55 "carried them a long way past the road of yellow brick that led to the"
55 "Emerald City."
55 ""
55 "“What shall we do now?” asked the Tin Woodman, as the Lion lay down on"
55 "the grass to let the sun dry him."
55 ""
55 "“We must get back to the road, in some way,” said Dorothy."
55 ""
55 "“The best plan will be to walk along the riverbank until we come to the"
55 "road again,” remarked the Lion."
55 ""
55 "So, when they were rested, Dorothy picked up her basket and they"
55 "started along the grassy bank, to the road from which the river had"
55 "carried them. It was a lovely country, with plenty of flowers and fruit"
55 "trees and sunshine to cheer them, and had they not felt so sorry for"
55 "the poor Scarecrow, they could have been very happy."
55 ""
55 "They walked along as fast as they could, Dorothy only stopping once to"
55 "pick a beautiful flower; and after a time the Tin Woodman cried out:"
55 "“Look!”"
55 ""
55 "Then they all looked at the river and saw the Scarecrow perched upon"
55 "his pole in the middle of the water, looking very lonely and sad."
55 ""
55 "“What can we do to save him?” asked Dorothy."
55 ""
55 "The Lion and the Woodman both shook their heads, for they did not know."
55 "So they sat down upon the bank and gazed wistfully at the Scarecrow"
55 "until a Stork flew by, who, upon seeing them, stopped to rest at the"
55 "water’s edge."
55 ""
55 "“Who are you and where are you going?” asked the Stork."
55 ""
55 "“I am Dorothy,” answered the girl, “and these are my friends, the Tin"
55 "Woodman and the Cowardly Lion; and we are going to the Emerald City.”"
55 ""
55 "“This isn’t the road,” said the Stork, as she twisted her long neck and"
55 "looked sharply at the queer party."
55 ""
55 "“I know it,” returned Dorothy, “but we have lost the Scarecrow, and are"
55 "wondering how we shall get him again.”"
55 ""
55 "“Where is he?” asked the Stork."
55 ""
55 "“Over there in the river,” answered the little girl."
55 ""
55 "“If he wasn’t so big and heavy I would get him for you,” remarked the"
55 "Stork."
55 ""
55 "“He isn’t heavy a bit,” said Dorothy eagerly, “for he is stuffed with"
55 "straw; and if you will bring him back to us, we shall thank you ever"
55 "and ever so much.”"
55 ""
55 "“Well, I’ll try,” said the Stork, “but if I find he is too heavy to"
55 "carry I shall have to drop him in the river again.”"
55 ""
55 "So the big bird flew into the air and over the water till she came to"
55 "where the Scarecrow was perched upon his pole. Then the Stork with her"
55 "great claws grabbed the Scarecrow by the arm and carried him up into"
55 "the air and back to the bank, where Dorothy and the Lion and the Tin"
55 "Woodman and Toto were sitting."
55 ""
55 "When the Scarecrow found himself among his friends again, he was so"
55 "happy that he hugged them all, even the Lion and Toto; and as they"
55 "walked along he sang “Tol-de-ri-de-oh!” at every step, he felt so gay."
55 ""
55 "“I was afraid I should have to stay in the river forever,” he said,"
55 "“but the kind Stork saved me, and if I ever get any brains I shall find"
55 "the Stork again and do her some kindness in return.”"
55 ""
55 "“That’s all right,” said the Stork, who was flying along beside them."
55 "“I always like to help anyone in trouble. But I must go now, for my"
55 "babies are waiting in the nest for me. I hope you will find the Emerald"
55 "City and that Oz will help you.”"
55 ""
55 "“Thank you,” replied Dorothy, and then the kind Stork flew into the air"
55 "and was soon out of sight."
55 ""
55 "They walked along listening to the singing of the brightly colored"
55 "birds and looking at the lovely flowers which now became so thick that"
55 "the ground was carpeted with them. There were big yellow and white and"
55 "blue and purple blossoms, besides great clusters of scarlet poppies,"
55 "which were so brilliant in color they almost dazzled Dorothy’s eyes."
55 ""
55 "“Aren’t they beautiful?” the girl asked, as she breathed in the spicy"
55 "scent of the bright flowers."
55 ""
55 "“I suppose so,” answered the Scarecrow. “When I have brains, I shall"
55 "probably like them better.”"
55 ""
55 "“If I only had a heart, I should love them,” added the Tin Woodman."
55 ""
55 "“I always did like flowers,” said the Lion. “They seem so helpless and"
55 "frail. But there are none in the forest so bright as these.”"
55 ""
55 "They now came upon more and more of the big scarlet poppies, and fewer"
55 "and fewer of the other flowers; and soon they found themselves in the"
55 "midst of a great meadow of poppies. Now it is well known that when"
55 "there are many of these flowers together their odor is so powerful that"
55 "anyone who breathes it falls asleep, and if the sleeper is not carried"
55 "away from the scent of the flowers, he sleeps on and on forever. But"
55 "Dorothy did not know this, nor could she get away from the bright red"
55 "flowers that were everywhere about; so presently her eyes grew heavy"
55 "and she felt she must sit down to rest and to sleep."
55 ""
55 "But the Tin Woodman would not let her do this."
55 ""
55 "“We must hurry and get back to the road of yellow brick before dark,”"
55 "he said; and the Scarecrow agreed with him. So they kept walking until"
55 "Dorothy could stand no longer. Her eyes closed in spite of herself and"
55 "she forgot where she was and fell among the poppies, fast asleep."
55 ""
55 "“What shall we do?” asked the Tin Woodman."
55 ""
55 "“If we leave her here she will die,” said the Lion. “The smell of the"
55 "flowers is killing us all. I myself can scarcely keep my eyes open, and"
55 "the dog is asleep already.”"
55 ""
55 "It was true; Toto had fallen down beside his little mistress. But the"
55 "Scarecrow and the Tin Woodman, not being made of flesh, were not"
55 "troubled by the scent of the flowers."
55 ""
55 "“Run fast,” said the Scarecrow to the Lion, “and get out of this deadly"
55 "flower bed as soon as you can. We will bring the little girl with us,"
55 "but if you should fall asleep you are too big to be carried.”"
55 ""
55 "So the Lion aroused himself and bounded forward as fast as he could go."
55 "In a moment he was out of sight."
55 ""
55 "“Let us make a chair with our hands and carry her,” said the Scarecrow."
55 "So they picked up Toto and put the dog in Dorothy’s lap, and then they"
55 "made a chair with their hands for the seat and their arms for the arms"
55 "and carried the sleeping girl between them through the flowers."
55 ""
55 "On and on they walked, and it seemed that the great carpet of deadly"
55 "flowers that surrounded them would never end. They followed the bend of"
55 "the river, and at last came upon their friend the Lion, lying fast"
55 "asleep among the poppies. The flowers had been too strong for the huge"
55 "beast and he had given up at last, and fallen only a short distance"
55 "from the end of the poppy bed, where the sweet grass spread in"
55 "beautiful green fields before them."
55 ""
55 "“We can do nothing for him,” said the Tin Woodman, sadly; “for he is"
55 "much too heavy to lift. We must leave him here to sleep on forever, and"
55 "perhaps he will dream that he has found courage at last.”"
55 ""
55 "“I’m sorry,” said the Scarecrow. “The Lion was a very good comrade for"
55 "one so cowardly. But let us go on.”"
55 ""
55 "They carried the sleeping girl to a pretty spot beside the river, far"
55 "enough from the poppy field to prevent her breathing any more of the"
55 "poison of the flowers, and here they laid her gently on the soft grass"
55 "and waited for the fresh breeze to waken her."

55 "<Chapter IX"
55 "The Queen of the Field Mice>"
55 ""
55 ""
55 "“We cannot be far from the road of yellow brick, now,” remarked the"
55 "Scarecrow, as he stood beside the girl, “for we have come nearly as far"
55 "as the river carried us away.”"
55 ""
55 "The Tin Woodman was about to reply when he heard a low growl, and"
55 "turning his head (which worked beautifully on hinges) he saw a strange"
55 "beast come bounding over the grass toward them. It was, indeed, a great"
55 "yellow Wildcat, and the Woodman thought it must be chasing something,"
55 "for its ears were lying close to its head and its mouth was wide open,"
55 "showing two rows of ugly teeth, while its red eyes glowed like balls of"
55 "fire. As it came nearer the Tin Woodman saw that running before the"
55 "beast was a little gray field mouse, and although he had no heart he"
55 "knew it was wrong for the Wildcat to try to kill such a pretty,"
55 "harmless creature."
55 ""
55 "So the Woodman raised his axe, and as the Wildcat ran by he gave it a"
55 "quick blow that cut the beast’s head clean off from its body, and it"
55 "rolled over at his feet in two pieces."
55 ""
55 "The field mouse, now that it was freed from its enemy, stopped short;"
55 "and coming slowly up to the Woodman it said, in a squeaky little voice:"
55 ""
55 "“Oh, thank you! Thank you ever so much for saving my life.”"
55 ""
55 "“Don’t speak of it, I beg of you,” replied the Woodman. “I have no"
55 "heart, you know, so I am careful to help all those who may need a"
55 "friend, even if it happens to be only a mouse.”"
55 ""
55 "“Only a mouse!” cried the little animal, indignantly. “Why, I am a"
55 "Queen—the Queen of all the Field Mice!”"
55 ""
55 "“Oh, indeed,” said the Woodman, making a bow."
55 ""
55 "“Therefore you have done a great deed, as well as a brave one, in"
55 "saving my life,” added the Queen."
55 ""
55 "At that moment several mice were seen running up as fast as their"
55 "little legs could carry them, and when they saw their Queen they"
55 "exclaimed:"
55 ""
55 "“Oh, your Majesty, we thought you would be killed! How did you manage"
55 "to escape the great Wildcat?” They all bowed so low to the little Queen"
55 "that they almost stood upon their heads."
55 ""
55 "“This funny tin man,” she answered, “killed the Wildcat and saved my"
55 "life. So hereafter you must all serve him, and obey his slightest"
55 "wish.”"
55 ""
55 "“We will!” cried all the mice, in a shrill chorus. And then they"
55 "scampered in all directions, for Toto had awakened from his sleep, and"
55 "seeing all these mice around him he gave one bark of delight and jumped"
55 "right into the middle of the group. Toto had always loved to chase mice"
55 "when he lived in Kansas, and he saw no harm in it."
55 ""
55 "But the Tin Woodman caught the dog in his arms and held him tight,"
55 "while he called to the mice, “Come back! Come back! Toto shall not hurt"
55 "you.”"
55 ""
55 "At this the Queen of the Mice stuck her head out from underneath a"
55 "clump of grass and asked, in a timid voice, “Are you sure he will not"
55 "bite us?”"
55 ""
55 "“I will not let him,” said the Woodman; “so do not be afraid.”"
55 ""
55 "One by one the mice came creeping back, and Toto did not bark again,"
55 "although he tried to get out of the Woodman’s arms, and would have"
55 "bitten him had he not known very well he was made of tin. Finally one"
55 "of the biggest mice spoke."
55 ""
55 "“Is there anything we can do,” it asked, “to repay you for saving the"
55 "life of our Queen?”"
55 ""
55 "“Nothing that I know of,” answered the Woodman; but the Scarecrow, who"
55 "had been trying to think, but could not because his head was stuffed"
55 "with straw, said, quickly, “Oh, yes; you can save our friend, the"
55 "Cowardly Lion, who is asleep in the poppy bed.”"
55 ""
55 "“A Lion!” cried the little Queen. “Why, he would eat us all up.”"
55 ""
55 "“Oh, no,” declared the Scarecrow; “this Lion is a coward.”"
55 ""
55 "“Really?” asked the Mouse."
55 ""
55 "“He says so himself,” answered the Scarecrow, “and he would never hurt"
55 "anyone who is our friend. If you will help us to save him I promise"
55 "that he shall treat you all with kindness.”"
55 ""
55 "“Very well,” said the Queen, “we trust you. But what shall we do?”"
55 ""
55 "“Are there many of these mice which call you Queen and are willing to"
55 "obey you?”"
55 ""
55 "“Oh, yes; there are thousands,” she replied."
55 ""
55 "“Then send for them all to come here as soon as possible, and let each"
55 "one bring a long piece of string.”"
55 ""
55 "The Queen turned to the mice that attended her and told them to go at"
55 "once and get all her people. As soon as they heard her orders they ran"
55 "away in every direction as fast as possible."
55 ""
55 "“Now,” said the Scarecrow to the Tin Woodman, “you must go to those"
55 "trees by the riverside and make a truck that will carry the Lion.”"
55 ""
55 "So the Woodman went at once to the trees and began to work; and he soon"
55 "made a truck out of the limbs of trees, from which he chopped away all"
55 "the leaves and branches. He fastened it together with wooden pegs and"
55 "made the four wheels out of short pieces of a big tree trunk. So fast"
55 "and so well did he work that by the time the mice began to arrive the"
55 "truck was all ready for them."
55 ""
55 "They came from all directions, and there were thousands of them: big"
55 "mice and little mice and middle-sized mice; and each one brought a"
55 "piece of string in his mouth. It was about this time that Dorothy woke"
55 "from her long sleep and opened her eyes. She was greatly astonished to"
55 "find herself lying upon the grass, with thousands of mice standing"
55 "around and looking at her timidly. But the Scarecrow told her about"
55 "everything, and turning to the dignified little Mouse, he said:"
55 ""
55 "“Permit me to introduce to you her Majesty, the Queen.”"
55 ""
55 "Dorothy nodded gravely and the Queen made a curtsy, after which she"
55 "became quite friendly with the little girl."
55 ""
55 "The Scarecrow and the Woodman now began to fasten the mice to the"
55 "truck, using the strings they had brought. One end of a string was tied"
55 "around the neck of each mouse and the other end to the truck. Of course"
55 "the truck was a thousand times bigger than any of the mice who were to"
55 "draw it; but when all the mice had been harnessed, they were able to"
55 "pull it quite easily. Even the Scarecrow and the Tin Woodman could sit"
55 "on it, and were drawn swiftly by their queer little horses to the place"
55 "where the Lion lay asleep."
55 ""
55 "After a great deal of hard work, for the Lion was heavy, they managed"
55 "to get him up on the truck. Then the Queen hurriedly gave her people"
55 "the order to start, for she feared if the mice stayed among the poppies"
55 "too long they also would fall asleep."
55 ""
55 "At first the little creatures, many though they were, could hardly stir"
55 "the heavily loaded truck; but the Woodman and the Scarecrow both pushed"
55 "from behind, and they got along better. Soon they rolled the Lion out"
55 "of the poppy bed to the green fields, where he could breathe the sweet,"
55 "fresh air again, instead of the poisonous scent of the flowers."
55 ""
55 "Dorothy came to meet them and thanked the little mice warmly for saving"
55 "her companion from death. She had grown so fond of the big Lion she was"
55 "glad he had been rescued."
55 ""
55 "Then the mice were unharnessed from the truck and scampered away"
55 "through the grass to their homes. The Queen of the Mice was the last to"
55 "leave."
55 ""
55 "“If ever you need us again,” she said, “come out into the field and"
55 "call, and we shall hear you and come to your assistance. Good-bye!”"
55 ""
55 "“Good-bye!” they all answered, and away the Queen ran, while Dorothy"
55 "held Toto tightly lest he should run after her and frighten her."
55 ""
55 "After this they sat down beside the Lion until he should awaken; and"
55 "the Scarecrow brought Dorothy some fruit from a tree near by, which she"
55 "ate for her dinner."

55 ""
55 "It was some time before the Cowardly Lion awakened, for he had lain"
55 "among the poppies a long while, breathing in their deadly fragrance;"
55 "but when he did open his eyes and roll off the truck he was very glad"
55 "to find himself still alive."
55 ""
55 "“I ran as fast as I could,” he said, sitting down and yawning, “but the"
55 "flowers were too strong for me. How did you get me out?”"
55 ""
55 "Then they told him of the field mice, and how they had generously saved"
55 "him from death; and the Cowardly Lion laughed, and said:"
55 ""
55 "“I have always thought myself very big and terrible; yet such little"
55 "things as flowers came near to killing me, and such small animals as"
55 "mice have saved my life. How strange it all is! But, comrades, what"
55 "shall we do now?”"
55 ""
55 "“We must journey on until we find the road of yellow brick again,” said"
55 "Dorothy, “and then we can keep on to the Emerald City.”"
55 ""
55 "So, the Lion being fully refreshed, and feeling quite himself again,"
55 "they all started upon the journey, greatly enjoying the walk through"
55 "the soft, fresh grass; and it was not long before they reached the road"
55 "of yellow brick and turned again toward the Emerald City where the"
55 "Great Oz dwelt."
55 ""
55 "The road was smooth and well paved, now, and the country about was"
55 "beautiful, so that the travelers rejoiced in leaving the forest far"
55 "behind, and with it the many dangers they had met in its gloomy shades."
55 "Once more they could see fences built beside the road; but these were"
55 "painted green, and when they came to a small house, in which a farmer"
55 "evidently lived, that also was painted green. They passed by several of"
55 "these houses during the afternoon, and sometimes people came to the"
55 "doors and looked at them as if they would like to ask questions; but no"
55 "one came near them nor spoke to them because of the great Lion, of"
55 "which they were very much afraid. The people were all dressed in"
55 "clothing of a lovely emerald-green color and wore peaked hats like"
55 "those of the Munchkins."
55 ""
55 "“This must be the Land of Oz,” said Dorothy, “and we are surely getting"
55 "near the Emerald City.”"
55 ""
55 "“Yes,” answered the Scarecrow. “Everything is green here, while in the"
55 "country of the Munchkins blue was the favorite color. But the people do"
55 "not seem to be as friendly as the Munchkins, and I’m afraid we shall be"
55 "unable to find a place to pass the night.”"
55 ""
55 "“I should like something to eat besides fruit,” said the girl, “and I’m"
55 "sure Toto is nearly starved. Let us stop at the next house and talk to"
55 "the people.”"
55 ""
55 "So, when they came to a good-sized farmhouse, Dorothy walked boldly up"
55 "to the door and knocked."
55 ""
55 "A woman opened it just far enough to look out, and said, “What do you"
55 "want, child, and why is that great Lion with you?”"
55 ""
55 "“We wish to pass the night with you, if you will allow us,” answered"
55 "Dorothy; “and the Lion is my friend and comrade, and would not hurt you"
55 "for the world.”"
55 ""
55 "“Is he tame?” asked the woman, opening the door a little wider."
55 ""
55 "“Oh, yes,” said the girl, “and he is a great coward, too. He will be"
55 "more afraid of you than you are of him.”"
55 ""
55 "“Well,” said the woman, after thinking it over and taking another peep"
55 "at the Lion, “if that is the case you may come in, and I will give you"
55 "some supper and a place to sleep.”"
55 ""
55 "So they all entered the house, where there were, besides the woman, two"
55 "children and a man. The man had hurt his leg, and was lying on the"
55 "couch in a corner. They seemed greatly surprised to see so strange a"
55 "company, and while the woman was busy laying the table the man asked:"
55 ""
55 "“Where are you all going?”"
55 ""
55 "“To the Emerald City,” said Dorothy, “to see the Great Oz.”"
55 ""
55 "“Oh, indeed!” exclaimed the man. “Are you sure that Oz will see you?”"
55 ""
55 "“Why not?” she replied."
55 ""
55 "“Why, it is said that he never lets anyone come into his presence. I"
55 "have been to the Emerald City many times, and it is a beautiful and"
55 "wonderful place; but I have never been permitted to see the Great Oz,"
55 "nor do I know of any living person who has seen him.”"
55 ""
55 "“Does he never go out?” asked the Scarecrow."
55 ""
55 "“Never. He sits day after day in the great Throne Room of his Palace,"
55 "and even those who wait upon him do not see him face to face.”"
55 ""
55 "“What is he like?” asked the girl."
55 ""
55 "“That is hard to tell,” said the man thoughtfully. “You see, Oz is a"
55 "Great Wizard, and can take on any form he wishes. So that some say he"
55 "looks like a bird; and some say he looks like an elephant; and some say"
55 "he looks like a cat. To others he appears as a beautiful fairy, or a"
55 "brownie, or in any other form that pleases him. But who the real Oz is,"
55 "when he is in his own form, no living person can tell.”"
55 ""
55 "“That is very strange,” said Dorothy, “but we must try, in some way, to"
55 "see him, or we shall have made our journey for nothing.”"
55 ""
55 "“Why do you wish to see the terrible Oz?” asked the man."
55 ""
55 "“I want him to give me some brains,” said the Scarecrow eagerly."
55 ""
55 "“Oh, Oz could do that easily enough,” declared the man. “He has more"
55 "brains than he needs.”"
55 ""
55 "“And I want him to give me a heart,” said the Tin Woodman."
55 ""
55 "“That will not trouble him,” continued the man, “for Oz has a large"
55 "collection of hearts, of all sizes and shapes.”"
55 ""
55 "“And I want him to give me courage,” said the Cowardly Lion."
55 ""
55 "“Oz keeps a great pot of courage in his Throne Room,” said the man,"
55 "“which he has covered with a golden plate, to keep it from running"
55 "over. He will be glad to give you some.”"
55 ""
55 "“And I want him to send me back to Kansas,” said Dorothy."
55 ""
55 "“Where is Kansas?” asked the man, with surprise."
55 ""
55 "“I don’t know,” replied Dorothy sorrowfully, “but it is my home, and"
55 "I’m sure it’s somewhere.”"
55 ""
55 "“Very likely. Well, Oz can do anything; so I suppose he will find"
55 "Kansas for you. But first you must get to see him, and that will be a"
55 "hard task; for the Great Wizard does not like to see anyone, and he"
55 "usually has his own way. But what do YOU want?” he continued, speaking"
55 "to Toto. Toto only wagged his tail; for, strange to say, he could not"
55 "speak."
55 ""
55 "The woman now called to them that supper was ready, so they gathered"
55 "around the table and Dorothy ate some delicious porridge and a dish of"
55 "scrambled eggs and a plate of nice white bread, and enjoyed her meal."
55 "The Lion ate some of the porridge, but did not care for it, saying it"
55 "was made from oats and oats were food for horses, not for lions. The"
55 "Scarecrow and the Tin Woodman ate nothing at all. Toto ate a little of"
55 "everything, and was glad to get a good supper again."
55 ""
55 "The woman now gave Dorothy a bed to sleep in, and Toto lay down beside"
55 "her, while the Lion guarded the door of her room so she might not be"
55 "disturbed. The Scarecrow and the Tin Woodman stood up in a corner and"
55 "kept quiet all night, although of course they could not sleep."
55 ""
55 "The next morning, as soon as the sun was up, they started on their way,"
55 "and soon saw a beautiful green glow in the sky just before them."
55 ""
55 "“That must be the Emerald City,” said Dorothy."
55 ""
55 "As they walked on, the green glow became brighter and brighter, and it"
55 "seemed that at last they were nearing the end of their travels. Yet it"
55 "was afternoon before they came to the great wall that surrounded the"
55 "City. It was high and thick and of a bright green color."
55 ""
55 "In front of them, and at the end of the road of yellow brick, was a big"
55 "gate, all studded with emeralds that glittered so in the sun that even"
55 "the painted eyes of the Scarecrow were dazzled by their brilliancy."
55 ""
55 "There was a bell beside the gate, and Dorothy pushed the button and"
55 "heard a silvery tinkle sound within. Then the big gate swung slowly"
55 "open, and they all passed through and found themselves in a high arched"
55 "room, the walls of which glistened with countless emeralds."
55 ""
55 "Before them stood a little man about the same size as the Munchkins. He"
55 "was clothed all in green, from his head to his feet, and even his skin"
55 "was of a greenish tint. At his side was a large green box."
55 ""
55 "When he saw Dorothy and her companions the man asked, “What do you wish"
55 "in the Emerald City?”"
55 ""
55 "“We came here to see the Great Oz,” said Dorothy."
55 ""
55 "The man was so surprised at this answer that he sat down to think it"
55 "over."
55 ""
55 "“It has been many years since anyone asked me to see Oz,” he said,"
55 "shaking his head in perplexity. “He is powerful and terrible, and if"
55 "you come on an idle or foolish errand to bother the wise reflections of"
55 "the Great Wizard, he might be angry and destroy you all in an instant.”"
55 ""
55 "“But it is not a foolish errand, nor an idle one,” replied the"
55 "Scarecrow; “it is important. And we have been told that Oz is a good"
55 "Wizard.”"
55 ""
55 "“So he is,” said the green man, “and he rules the Emerald City wisely"
55 "and well. But to those who are not honest, or who approach him from"
55 "curiosity, he is most terrible, and few have ever dared ask to see his"
55 "face. I am the Guardian of the Gates, and since you demand to see the"
55 "Great Oz I must take you to his Palace. But first you must put on the"
55 "spectacles.”"
55 ""
55 "“Why?” asked Dorothy."
55 ""
55 "“Because if you did not wear spectacles the brightness and glory of the"
55 "Emerald City would blind you. Even those who live in the City must wear"
55 "spectacles night and day. They are all locked on, for Oz so ordered it"
55 "when the City was first built, and I have the only key that will unlock"
55 "them.”"
55 ""
55 "He opened the big box, and Dorothy saw that it was filled with"
55 "spectacles of every size and shape. All of them had green glasses in"
55 "them. The Guardian of the Gates found a pair that would just fit"
55 "Dorothy and put them over her eyes. There were two golden bands"
55 "fastened to them that passed around the back of her head, where they"
55 "were locked together by a little key that was at the end of a chain the"
55 "Guardian of the Gates wore around his neck. When they were on, Dorothy"
55 "could not take them off had she wished, but of course she did not wish"
55 "to be blinded by the glare of the Emerald City, so she said nothing."
55 ""
55 "Then the green man fitted spectacles for the Scarecrow and the Tin"
55 "Woodman and the Lion, and even on little Toto; and all were locked fast"
55 "with the key."
55 ""
55 "Then the Guardian of the Gates put on his own glasses and told them he"
55 "was ready to show them to the Palace. Taking a big golden key from a"
55 "peg on the wall, he opened another gate, and they all followed him"
55 "through the portal into the streets of the Emerald City."

55 "The Wonderful City of Oz>"
55 ""
55 ""
55 "Even with eyes protected by the green spectacles, Dorothy and her"
55 "friends were at first dazzled by the brilliancy of the wonderful City."
55 "The streets were lined with beautiful houses all built of green marble"
55 "and studded everywhere with sparkling emeralds. They walked over a"
55 "pavement of the same green marble, and where the blocks were joined"
55 "together were rows of emeralds, set closely, and glittering in the"
55 "brightness of the sun. The window panes were of green glass; even the"
55 "sky above the City had a green tint, and the rays of the sun were"
55 "green."
55 ""
55 "There were many people—men, women, and children—walking about, and"
55 "these were all dressed in green clothes and had greenish skins. They"
55 "looked at Dorothy and her strangely assorted company with wondering"
55 "eyes, and the children all ran away and hid behind their mothers when"
55 "they saw the Lion; but no one spoke to them. Many shops stood in the"
55 "street, and Dorothy saw that everything in them was green. Green candy"
55 "and green pop corn were offered for sale, as well as green shoes, green"
55 "hats, and green clothes of all sorts. At one place a man was selling"
55 "green lemonade, and when the children bought it Dorothy could see that"
55 "they paid for it with green pennies."
55 ""
55 "There seemed to be no horses nor animals of any kind; the men carried"
55 "things around in little green carts, which they pushed before them."
55 "Everyone seemed happy and contented and prosperous."
55 ""
55 "The Guardian of the Gates led them through the streets until they came"
55 "to a big building, exactly in the middle of the City, which was the"
55 "Palace of Oz, the Great Wizard. There was a soldier before the door,"
55 "dressed in a green uniform and wearing a long green beard."
55 ""
55 "“Here are strangers,” said the Guardian of the Gates to him, “and they"
55 "demand to see the Great Oz.”"
55 ""
55 "“Step inside,” answered the soldier, “and I will carry your message to"
55 "him.”"
55 ""
55 "So they passed through the Palace Gates and were led into a big room"
55 "with a green carpet and lovely green furniture set with emeralds. The"
55 "soldier made them all wipe their feet upon a green mat before entering"
55 "this room, and when they were seated he said politely:"
55 ""
55 "“Please make yourselves comfortable while I go to the door of the"
55 "Throne Room and tell Oz you are here.”"
55 ""
55 "They had to wait a long time before the soldier returned. When, at"
55 "last, he came back, Dorothy asked:"
55 ""
55 "“Have you seen Oz?”"
55 ""
55 "“Oh, no,” returned the soldier; “I have never seen him. But I spoke to"
55 "him as he sat behind his screen and gave him your message. He said he"
55 "will grant you an audience, if you so desire; but each one of you must"
55 "enter his presence alone, and he will admit but one each day."
55 "Therefore, as you must remain in the Palace for several days, I will"
55 "have you shown to rooms where you may rest in comfort after your"
55 "journey.”"
55 ""
55 "“Thank you,” replied the girl; “that is very kind of Oz.”"
55 ""
55 "The soldier now blew upon a green whistle, and at once a young girl,"
55 "dressed in a pretty green silk gown, entered the room. She had lovely"
55 "green hair and green eyes, and she bowed low before Dorothy as she"
55 "said, “Follow me and I will show you your room.”"
55 ""
55 "So Dorothy said good-bye to all her friends except Toto, and taking the"
55 "dog in her arms followed the green girl through seven passages and up"
55 "three flights of stairs until they came to a room at the front of the"
55 "Palace. It was the sweetest little room in the world, with a soft"
55 "comfortable bed that had sheets of green silk and a green velvet"
55 "counterpane. There was a tiny fountain in the middle of the room, that"
55 "shot a spray of green perfume into the air, to fall back into a"
55 "beautifully carved green marble basin. Beautiful green flowers stood in"
55 "the windows, and there was a shelf with a row of little green books."
55 "When Dorothy had time to open these books she found them full of queer"
55 "green pictures that made her laugh, they were so funny."
55 ""
55 "In a wardrobe were many green dresses, made of silk and satin and"
55 "velvet; and all of them fitted Dorothy exactly."
55 ""
55 "“Make yourself perfectly at home,” said the green girl, “and if you"
55 "wish for anything ring the bell. Oz will send for you tomorrow"
55 "morning.”"
55 ""
55 "She left Dorothy alone and went back to the others. These she also led"
55 "to rooms, and each one of them found himself lodged in a very pleasant"
55 "part of the Palace. Of course this politeness was wasted on the"
55 "Scarecrow; for when he found himself alone in his room he stood"
55 "stupidly in one spot, just within the doorway, to wait till morning. It"
55 "would not rest him to lie down, and he could not close his eyes; so he"
55 "remained all night staring at a little spider which was weaving its web"
55 "in a corner of the room, just as if it were not one of the most"
55 "wonderful rooms in the world. The Tin Woodman lay down on his bed from"
55 "force of habit, for he remembered when he was made of flesh; but not"
55 "being able to sleep, he passed the night moving his joints up and down"
55 "to make sure they kept in good working order. The Lion would have"
55 "preferred a bed of dried leaves in the forest, and did not like being"
55 "shut up in a room; but he had too much sense to let this worry him, so"
55 "he sprang upon the bed and rolled himself up like a cat and purred"
55 "himself asleep in a minute."
55 ""
55 "The next morning, after breakfast, the green maiden came to fetch"
55 "Dorothy, and she dressed her in one of the prettiest gowns, made of"
55 "green brocaded satin. Dorothy put on a green silk apron and tied a"
55 "green ribbon around Toto’s neck, and they started for the Throne Room"
55 "of the Great Oz."
55 ""
55 "First they came to a great hall in which were many ladies and gentlemen"
55 "of the court, all dressed in rich costumes. These people had nothing to"
55 "do but talk to each other, but they always came to wait outside the"
55 "Throne Room every morning, although they were never permitted to see"
55 "Oz. As Dorothy entered they looked at her curiously, and one of them"
55 "whispered:"
55 ""
55 "“Are you really going to look upon the face of Oz the Terrible?”"
55 ""
55 "“Of course,” answered the girl, “if he will see me.”"
55 ""
55 "“Oh, he will see you,” said the soldier who had taken her message to"
55 "the Wizard, “although he does not like to have people ask to see him."
55 "Indeed, at first he was angry and said I should send you back where you"
55 "came from. Then he asked me what you looked like, and when I mentioned"
55 "your silver shoes he was very much interested. At last I told him about"
55 "the mark upon your forehead, and he decided he would admit you to his"
55 "presence.”"
55 ""
55 "Just then a bell rang, and the green girl said to Dorothy, “That is the"
55 "signal. You must go into the Throne Room alone.”"
55 ""
55 "She opened a little door and Dorothy walked boldly through and found"
55 "herself in a wonderful place. It was a big, round room with a high"
55 "arched roof, and the walls and ceiling and floor were covered with"
55 "large emeralds set closely together. In the center of the roof was a"
55 "great light, as bright as the sun, which made the emeralds sparkle in a"
55 "wonderful manner."
55 ""
55 "But what interested Dorothy most was the big throne of green marble"
55 "that stood in the middle of the room. It was shaped like a chair and"
55 "sparkled with gems, as did everything else. In the center of the chair"
55 "was an enormous Head, without a body to support it or any arms or legs"
55 "whatever. There was no hair upon this head, but it had eyes and a nose"
55 "and mouth, and was much bigger than the head of the biggest giant."
55 ""
55 "As Dorothy gazed upon this in wonder and fear, the eyes turned slowly"
55 "and looked at her sharply and steadily. Then the mouth moved, and"
55 "Dorothy heard a voice say:"
55 ""
55 "“I am Oz, the Great and Terrible. Who are you, and why do you seek me?”"
55 ""
55 "It was not such an awful voice as she had expected to come from the big"
55 "Head; so she took courage and answered:"
55 ""
55 "“I am Dorothy, the Small and Meek. I have come to you for help.”"
55 ""
55 "The eyes looked at her thoughtfully for a full minute. Then said the"
55 "voice:"
55 ""
55 "“Where did you get the silver shoes?”"
55 ""
55 "“I got them from the Wicked Witch of the East, when my house fell on"
55 "her and killed her,” she replied."
55 ""
55 "“Where did you get the mark upon your forehead?” continued the voice."
55 ""
55 "“That is where the Good Witch of the North kissed me when she bade me"
55 "good-bye and sent me to you,” said the girl."
55 ""
55 "Again the eyes looked at her sharply, and they saw she was telling the"
55 "truth. Then Oz asked, “What do you wish me to do?”"
55 ""
55 "“Send me back to Kansas, where my Aunt Em and Uncle Henry are,” she"
55 "answered earnestly. “I don’t like your country, although it is so"
55 "beautiful. And I am sure Aunt Em will be dreadfully worried over my"
55 "being away so long.”"
55 ""
55 "The eyes winked three times, and then they turned up to the ceiling and"
55 "down to the floor and rolled around so queerly that they seemed to see"
55 "every part of the room. And at last they looked at Dorothy again."
55 ""
55 "“Why should I do this for you?” asked Oz."
55 ""
55 "“Because you are strong and I am weak; because you are a Great Wizard"
55 "and I am only a little girl.”"
55 ""
55 "“But you were strong enough to kill the Wicked Witch of the East,” said"
55 "Oz."
55 ""
55 "“That just happened,” returned Dorothy simply; “I could not help it.”"
55 ""
55 "“Well,” said the Head, “I will give you my answer. You have no right to"
55 "expect me to send you back to Kansas unless you do something for me in"
55 "return. In this country everyone must pay for everything he gets. If"
55 "you wish me to use my magic power to send you home again you must do"
55 "something for me first. Help me and I will help you.”"
55 ""
55 "“What must I do?” asked the girl."
55 ""
55 "“Kill the Wicked Witch of the West,” answered Oz."
55 ""
55 "“But I cannot!” exclaimed Dorothy, greatly surprised."
55 ""
55 "“You killed the Witch of the East and you wear the silver shoes, which"
55 "bear a powerful charm. There is now but one Wicked Witch left in all"
55 "this land, and when you can tell me she is dead I will send you back to"
55 "Kansas—but not before.”"
55 ""
55 "The little girl began to weep, she was so much disappointed; and the"
55 "eyes winked again and looked upon her anxiously, as if the Great Oz"
55 "felt that she could help him if she would."
55 ""
55 "“I never killed anything, willingly,” she sobbed. “Even if I wanted to,"
55 "how could I kill the Wicked Witch? If you, who are Great and Terrible,"
55 "cannot kill her yourself, how do you expect me to do it?”"
55 ""
55 "“I do not know,” said the Head; “but that is my answer, and until the"
55 "Wicked Witch dies you will not see your uncle and aunt again. Remember"
55 "that the Witch is Wicked—tremendously Wicked—and ought to be killed."
55 "Now go, and do not ask to see me again until you have done your task.”"
55 ""
55 "Sorrowfully Dorothy left the Throne Room and went back where the Lion"
55 "and the Scarecrow and the Tin Woodman were waiting to hear what Oz had"
55 "said to her. “There is no hope for me,” she said sadly, “for Oz will"
55 "not send me home until I have killed the Wicked Witch of the West; and"
55 "that I can never do.”"
55 ""
55 "Her friends were sorry, but could do nothing to help her; so Dorothy"
55 "went to her own room and lay down on the bed and cried herself to"
55 "sleep."
55 ""
55 "The next morning the soldier with the green whiskers came to the"
55 "Scarecrow and said:"
55 ""
55 "“Come with me, for Oz has sent for you.”"
55 ""
55 "So the Scarecrow followed him and was admitted into the great Throne"
55 "Room, where he saw, sitting in the emerald throne, a most lovely Lady."
55 "She was dressed in green silk gauze and wore upon her flowing green"
55 "locks a crown of jewels. Growing from her shoulders were wings,"
55 "gorgeous in color and so light that they fluttered if the slightest"
55 "breath of air reached them."
55 ""
55 "When the Scarecrow had bowed, as prettily as his straw stuffing would"
55 "let him, before this beautiful creature, she looked upon him sweetly,"
55 "and said:"
55 ""
55 "“I am Oz, the Great and Terrible. Who are you, and why do you seek me?”"
55 ""
55 "Now the Scarecrow, who had expected to see the great Head Dorothy had"
55 "told him of, was much astonished; but he answered her bravely."
55 ""
55 "“I am only a Scarecrow, stuffed with straw. Therefore I have no brains,"
55 "and I come to you praying that you will put brains in my head instead"
55 "of straw, so that I may become as much a man as any other in your"
55 "dominions.”"
55 ""
55 "“Why should I do this for you?” asked the Lady."
55 ""
55 "“Because you are wise and powerful, and no one else can help me,”"
55 "answered the Scarecrow."
55 ""
55 "“I never grant favors without some return,” said Oz; “but this much I"
55 "will promise. If you will kill for me the Wicked Witch of the West, I"
55 "will bestow upon you a great many brains, and such good brains that you"
55 "will be the wisest man in all the Land of Oz.”"
55 ""
55 "“I thought you asked Dorothy to kill the Witch,” said the Scarecrow, in"
55 "surprise."
55 ""
55 "“So I did. I don’t care who kills her. But until she is dead I will not"
55 "grant your wish. Now go, and do not seek me again until you have earned"
55 "the brains you so greatly desire.”"
55 ""
55 "The Scarecrow went sorrowfully back to his friends and told them what"
55 "Oz had said; and Dorothy was surprised to find that the Great Wizard"
55 "was not a Head, as she had seen him, but a lovely Lady."
55 ""
55 "“All the same,” said the Scarecrow, “she needs a heart as much as the"
55 "Tin Woodman.”"
55 ""
55 "On the next morning the soldier with the green whiskers came to the Tin"
55 "Woodman and said:"
55 ""
55 "“Oz has sent for you. Follow me.”"
55 ""
55 "So the Tin Woodman followed him and came to the great Throne Room. He"
55 "did not know whether he would find Oz a lovely Lady or a Head, but he"
55 "hoped it would be the lovely Lady. “For,” he said to himself, “if it is"
55 "the head, I am sure I shall not be given a heart, since a head has no"
55 "heart of its own and therefore cannot feel for me. But if it is the"
55 "lovely Lady I shall beg hard for a heart, for all ladies are themselves"
55 "said to be kindly hearted.”"
55 ""
55 "But when the Woodman entered the great Throne Room he saw neither the"
55 "Head nor the Lady, for Oz had taken the shape of a most terrible Beast."
55 "It was nearly as big as an elephant, and the green throne seemed hardly"
55 "strong enough to hold its weight. The Beast had a head like that of a"
55 "rhinoceros, only there were five eyes in its face. There were five long"
55 "arms growing out of its body, and it also had five long, slim legs."
55 "Thick, woolly hair covered every part of it, and a more"
55 "dreadful-looking monster could not be imagined. It was fortunate the"
55 "Tin Woodman had no heart at that moment, for it would have beat loud"
55 "and fast from terror. But being only tin, the Woodman was not at all"
55 "afraid, although he was much disappointed."
55 ""
55 "“I am Oz, the Great and Terrible,” spoke the Beast, in a voice that was"
55 "one great roar. “Who are you, and why do you seek me?”"
55 ""
55 "“I am a Woodman, and made of tin. Therefore I have no heart, and cannot"
55 "love. I pray you to give me a heart that I may be as other men are.”"
55 ""
55 "“Why should I do this?” demanded the Beast."
55 ""
55 "“Because I ask it, and you alone can grant my request,” answered the"
55 "Woodman."
55 ""
55 "Oz gave a low growl at this, but said, gruffly: “If you indeed desire a"
55 "heart, you must earn it.”"
55 ""
55 "“How?” asked the Woodman."
55 ""
55 "“Help Dorothy to kill the Wicked Witch of the West,” replied the Beast."
55 "“When the Witch is dead, come to me, and I will then give you the"
55 "biggest and kindest and most loving heart in all the Land of Oz.”"
55 ""
55 "So the Tin Woodman was forced to return sorrowfully to his friends and"
55 "tell them of the terrible Beast he had seen. They all wondered greatly"
55 "at the many forms the Great Wizard could take upon himself, and the"
55 "Lion said:"
55 ""
55 "“If he is a Beast when I go to see him, I shall roar my loudest, and so"
55 "frighten him that he will grant all I ask. And if he is the lovely"
55 "Lady, I shall pretend to spring upon her, and so compel her to do my"
55 "bidding. And if he is the great Head, he will be at my mercy; for I"
55 "will roll this head all about the room until he promises to give us"
55 "what we desire. So be of good cheer, my friends, for all will yet be"
55 "well.”"
55 ""
55 "The next morning the soldier with the green whiskers led the Lion to"
55 "the great Throne Room and bade him enter the presence of Oz."
55 ""
55 "The Lion at once passed through the door, and glancing around saw, to"
55 "his surprise, that before the throne was a Ball of Fire, so fierce and"
55 "glowing he could scarcely bear to gaze upon it. His first thought was"
55 "that Oz had by accident caught on fire and was burning up; but when he"
55 "tried to go nearer, the heat was so intense that it singed his"
55 "whiskers, and he crept back tremblingly to a spot nearer the door."
55 ""
55 "Then a low, quiet voice came from the Ball of Fire, and these were the"
55 "words it spoke:"
55 ""
55 "“I am Oz, the Great and Terrible. Who are you, and why do you seek me?”"
55 ""
55 "And the Lion answered, “I am a Cowardly Lion, afraid of everything. I"
55 "came to you to beg that you give me courage, so that in reality I may"
55 "become the King of Beasts, as men call me.”"
55 ""
55 "“Why should I give you courage?” demanded Oz."
55 ""
55 "“Because of all Wizards you are the greatest, and alone have power to"
55 "grant my request,” answered the Lion."
55 ""
55 "The Ball of Fire burned fiercely for a time, and the voice said, “Bring"
55 "me proof that the Wicked Witch is dead, and that moment I will give you"
55 "courage. But as long as the Witch lives, you must remain a coward.”"
55 ""
55 "The Lion was angry at this speech, but could say nothing in reply, and"
55 "while he stood silently gazing at the Ball of Fire it became so"
55 "furiously hot that he turned tail and rushed from the room. He was glad"
55 "to find his friends waiting for him, and told them of his terrible"
55 "interview with the Wizard."
55 ""
55 "“What shall we do now?” asked Dorothy sadly."
55 ""
55 "“There is only one thing we can do,” returned the Lion, “and that is to"
55 "go to the land of the Winkies, seek out the Wicked Witch, and destroy"
55 "her.”"
55 ""
55 "“But suppose we cannot?” said the girl."
55 ""
55 "“Then I shall never have courage,” declared the Lion."
55 ""
55 "“And I shall never have brains,” added the Scarecrow."
55 ""
55 "“And I shall never have a heart,” spoke the Tin Woodman."
55 ""
55 "“And I shall never see Aunt Em and Uncle Henry,” said Dorothy,"
55 "beginning to cry."
55 ""
55 "“Be careful!” cried the green girl. “The tears will fall on your green"
55 "silk gown and spot it.”"
55 ""
55 "So Dorothy dried her eyes and said, “I suppose we must try it; but I am"
55 "sure I do not want to kill anybody, even to see Aunt Em again.”"
55 ""
55 "“I will go with you; but I’m too much of a coward to kill the Witch,”"
55 "said the Lion."
55 ""
55 "“I will go too,” declared the Scarecrow; “but I shall not be of much"
55 "help to you, I am such a fool.”"
55 ""
55 "“I haven’t the heart to harm even a Witch,” remarked the Tin Woodman;"
55 "“but if you go I certainly shall go with you.”"
55 ""
55 "Therefore it was decided to start upon their journey the next morning,"
55 "and the Woodman sharpened his axe on a green grindstone and had all his"
55 "joints properly oiled. The Scarecrow stuffed himself with fresh straw"
55 "and Dorothy put new paint on his eyes that he might see better. The"
55 "green girl, who was very kind to them, filled Dorothy’s basket with"
55 "good things to eat, and fastened a little bell around Toto’s neck with"
55 "a green ribbon."

55 "They went to bed quite early and slept soundly until daylight, when"

55 "The soldier with the green whiskers led them through the streets of the"
55 "Emerald City until they reached the room where the Guardian of the"
55 "Gates lived. This officer unlocked their spectacles to put them back in"
55 "his great box, and then he politely opened the gate for our friends."
55 ""
55 "“Which road leads to the Wicked Witch of the West?” asked Dorothy."
55 ""
55 "“There is no road,” answered the Guardian of the Gates. “No one ever"
55 "wishes to go that way.”"
55 ""
55 "“How, then, are we to find her?” inquired the girl."
55 ""
55 "“That will be easy,” replied the man, “for when she knows you are in"
55 "the country of the Winkies she will find you, and make you all her"
55 "slaves.”"
55 ""
55 "“Perhaps not,” said the Scarecrow, “for we mean to destroy her.”"
55 ""
55 "“Oh, that is different,” said the Guardian of the Gates. “No one has"
55 "ever destroyed her before, so I naturally thought she would make slaves"
55 "of you, as she has of the rest. But take care; for she is wicked and"
55 "fierce, and may not allow you to destroy her. Keep to the West, where"
55 "the sun sets, and you cannot fail to find her.”"
55 ""
55 "They thanked him and bade him good-bye, and turned toward the West,"
55 "walking over fields of soft grass dotted here and there with daisies"
55 "and buttercups. Dorothy still wore the pretty silk dress she had put on"
55 "in the palace, but now, to her surprise, she found it was no longer"
55 "green, but pure white. The ribbon around Toto’s neck had also lost its"
55 "green color and was as white as Dorothy’s dress."
55 ""
55 "The Emerald City was soon left far behind. As they advanced the ground"
55 "became rougher and hillier, for there were no farms nor houses in this"
55 "country of the West, and the ground was untilled."
55 ""
55 "In the afternoon the sun shone hot in their faces, for there were no"
55 "trees to offer them shade; so that before night Dorothy and Toto and"
55 "the Lion were tired, and lay down upon the grass and fell asleep, with"
55 "the Woodman and the Scarecrow keeping watch."
55 ""
55 "Now the Wicked Witch of the West had but one eye, yet that was as"
55 "powerful as a telescope, and could see everywhere. So, as she sat in"
55 "the door of her castle, she happened to look around and saw Dorothy"
55 "lying asleep, with her friends all about her. They were a long distance"
55 "off, but the Wicked Witch was angry to find them in her country; so she"
55 "blew upon a silver whistle that hung around her neck."
55 ""
55 "At once there came running to her from all directions a pack of great"
55 "wolves. They had long legs and fierce eyes and sharp teeth."
55 ""
55 "“Go to those people,” said the Witch, “and tear them to pieces.”"
55 ""
55 "“Are you not going to make them your slaves?” asked the leader of the"
55 "wolves."
55 ""
55 "“No,” she answered, “one is of tin, and one of straw; one is a girl and"
55 "another a Lion. None of them is fit to work, so you may tear them into"
55 "small pieces.”"
55 ""
55 "“Very well,” said the wolf, and he dashed away at full speed, followed"
55 "by the others."
55 ""
55 "It was lucky the Scarecrow and the Woodman were wide awake and heard"
55 "the wolves coming."
55 ""
55 "“This is my fight,” said the Woodman, “so get behind me and I will meet"
55 "them as they come.”"
55 ""
55 "He seized his axe, which he had made very sharp, and as the leader of"
55 "the wolves came on the Tin Woodman swung his arm and chopped the wolf’s"
55 "head from its body, so that it immediately died. As soon as he could"
55 "raise his axe another wolf came up, and he also fell under the sharp"
55 "edge of the Tin Woodman’s weapon. There were forty wolves, and forty"
55 "times a wolf was killed, so that at last they all lay dead in a heap"
55 "before the Woodman."
55 ""
55 "Then he put down his axe and sat beside the Scarecrow, who said, “It"
55 "was a good fight, friend.”"
55 ""
55 "They waited until Dorothy awoke the next morning. The little girl was"
55 "quite frightened when she saw the great pile of shaggy wolves, but the"
55 "Tin Woodman told her all. She thanked him for saving them and sat down"
55 "to breakfast, after which they started again upon their journey."
55 ""
55 "Now this same morning the Wicked Witch came to the door of her castle"
55 "and looked out with her one eye that could see far off. She saw all her"
55 "wolves lying dead, and the strangers still traveling through her"
55 "country. This made her angrier than before, and she blew her silver"
55 "whistle twice."
55 ""
55 "Straightway a great flock of wild crows came flying toward her, enough"
55 "to darken the sky."
55 ""
55 "And the Wicked Witch said to the King Crow, “Fly at once to the"
55 "strangers; peck out their eyes and tear them to pieces.”"
55 ""
55 "The wild crows flew in one great flock toward Dorothy and her"
55 "companions. When the little girl saw them coming she was afraid."
55 ""
55 "But the Scarecrow said, “This is my battle, so lie down beside me and"
55 "you will not be harmed.”"
55 ""
55 "So they all lay upon the ground except the Scarecrow, and he stood up"
55 "and stretched out his arms. And when the crows saw him they were"
55 "frightened, as these birds always are by scarecrows, and did not dare"
55 "to come any nearer. But the King Crow said:"
55 ""
55 "“It is only a stuffed man. I will peck his eyes out.”"
55 ""
55 "The King Crow flew at the Scarecrow, who caught it by the head and"
55 "twisted its neck until it died. And then another crow flew at him, and"
55 "the Scarecrow twisted its neck also. There were forty crows, and forty"
55 "times the Scarecrow twisted a neck, until at last all were lying dead"
55 "beside him. Then he called to his companions to rise, and again they"
55 "went upon their journey."
55 ""
55 "When the Wicked Witch looked out again and saw all her crows lying in a"
55 "heap, she got into a terrible rage, and blew three times upon her"
55 "silver whistle."
55 ""
55 "Forthwith there was heard a great buzzing in the air, and a swarm of"
55 "black bees came flying toward her."
55 ""
55 "“Go to the strangers and sting them to death!” commanded the Witch, and"
55 "the bees turned and flew rapidly until they came to where Dorothy and"
55 "her friends were walking. But the Woodman had seen them coming, and the"
55 "Scarecrow had decided what to do."
55 ""
55 "“Take out my straw and scatter it over the little girl and the dog and"
55 "the Lion,” he said to the Woodman, “and the bees cannot sting them.”"
55 "This the Woodman did, and as Dorothy lay close beside the Lion and held"
55 "Toto in her arms, the straw covered them entirely."
55 ""
55 "The bees came and found no one but the Woodman to sting, so they flew"
55 "at him and broke off all their stings against the tin, without hurting"
55 "the Woodman at all. And as bees cannot live when their stings are"
55 "broken that was the end of the black bees, and they lay scattered thick"
55 "about the Woodman, like little heaps of fine coal."
55 ""
55 "Then Dorothy and the Lion got up, and the girl helped the Tin Woodman"
55 "put the straw back into the Scarecrow again, until he was as good as"
55 "ever. So they started upon their journey once more."
55 ""
55 "The Wicked Witch was so angry when she saw her black bees in little"
55 "heaps like fine coal that she stamped her foot and tore her hair and"
55 "gnashed her teeth. And then she called a dozen of her slaves, who were"
55 "the Winkies, and gave them sharp spears, telling them to go to the"
55 "strangers and destroy them."
55 ""
55 "The Winkies were not a brave people, but they had to do as they were"
55 "told. So they marched away until they came near to Dorothy. Then the"
55 "Lion gave a great roar and sprang towards them, and the poor Winkies"
55 "were so frightened that they ran back as fast as they could."
55 ""
55 "When they returned to the castle the Wicked Witch beat them well with a"
55 "strap, and sent them back to their work, after which she sat down to"
55 "think what she should do next. She could not understand how all her"
55 "plans to destroy these strangers had failed; but she was a powerful"
55 "Witch, as well as a wicked one, and she soon made up her mind how to"
55 "act."
55 ""
55 "There was, in her cupboard, a Golden Cap, with a circle of diamonds and"
55 "rubies running round it. This Golden Cap had a charm. Whoever owned it"
55 "could call three times upon the Winged Monkeys, who would obey any"
55 "order they were given. But no person could command these strange"
55 "creatures more than three times. Twice already the Wicked Witch had"
55 "used the charm of the Cap. Once was when she had made the Winkies her"
55 "slaves, and set herself to rule over their country. The Winged Monkeys"
55 "had helped her do this. The second time was when she had fought against"
55 "the Great Oz himself, and driven him out of the land of the West. The"
55 "Winged Monkeys had also helped her in doing this. Only once more could"
55 "she use this Golden Cap, for which reason she did not like to do so"
55 "until all her other powers were exhausted. But now that her fierce"
55 "wolves and her wild crows and her stinging bees were gone, and her"
55 "slaves had been scared away by the Cowardly Lion, she saw there was"
55 "only one way left to destroy Dorothy and her friends."
55 ""
55 "So the Wicked Witch took the Golden Cap from her cupboard and placed it"
55 "upon her head. Then she stood upon her left foot and said slowly:"
55 ""
55 "“Ep-pe, pep-pe, kak-ke!”"
55 ""
55 "Next she stood upon her right foot and said:"
55 ""
55 "“Hil-lo, hol-lo, hel-lo!”"
55 ""
55 "After this she stood upon both feet and cried in a loud voice:"
55 ""
55 "“Ziz-zy, zuz-zy, zik!”"
55 ""
55 "Now the charm began to work. The sky was darkened, and a low rumbling"
55 "sound was heard in the air. There was a rushing of many wings, a great"
55 "chattering and laughing, and the sun came out of the dark sky to show"
55 "the Wicked Witch surrounded by a crowd of monkeys, each with a pair of"
55 "immense and powerful wings on his shoulders."
55 ""
55 "One, much bigger than the others, seemed to be their leader. He flew"
55 "close to the Witch and said, “You have called us for the third and last"
55 "time. What do you command?”"
55 ""
55 "“Go to the strangers who are within my land and destroy them all except"
55 "the Lion,” said the Wicked Witch. “Bring that beast to me, for I have a"
55 "mind to harness him like a horse, and make him work.”"
55 ""
55 "“Your commands shall be obeyed,” said the leader. Then, with a great"
55 "deal of chattering and noise, the Winged Monkeys flew away to the place"
55 "where Dorothy and her friends were walking."
55 ""
55 "Some of the Monkeys seized the Tin Woodman and carried him through the"
55 "air until they were over a country thickly covered with sharp rocks."
55 "Here they dropped the poor Woodman, who fell a great distance to the"
55 "rocks, where he lay so battered and dented that he could neither move"
55 "nor groan."
55 ""
55 "Others of the Monkeys caught the Scarecrow, and with their long fingers"
55 "pulled all of the straw out of his clothes and head. They made his hat"
55 "and boots and clothes into a small bundle and threw it into the top"
55 "branches of a tall tree."
55 ""
55 "The remaining Monkeys threw pieces of stout rope around the Lion and"
55 "wound many coils about his body and head and legs, until he was unable"
55 "to bite or scratch or struggle in any way. Then they lifted him up and"
55 "flew away with him to the Witch’s castle, where he was placed in a"
55 "small yard with a high iron fence around it, so that he could not"
55 "escape."
55 ""
55 "But Dorothy they did not harm at all. She stood, with Toto in her arms,"
55 "watching the sad fate of her comrades and thinking it would soon be her"
55 "turn. The leader of the Winged Monkeys flew up to her, his long, hairy"
55 "arms stretched out and his ugly face grinning terribly; but he saw the"
55 "mark of the Good Witch’s kiss upon her forehead and stopped short,"
55 "motioning the others not to touch her."
55 ""
55 "“We dare not harm this little girl,” he said to them, “for she is"
55 "protected by the Power of Good, and that is greater than the Power of"
55 "Evil. All we can do is to carry her to the castle of the Wicked Witch"
55 "and leave her there.”"
55 ""
55 "So, carefully and gently, they lifted Dorothy in their arms and carried"
55 "her swiftly through the air until they came to the castle, where they"
55 "set her down upon the front doorstep. Then the leader said to the"
55 "Witch:"
55 ""
55 "“We have obeyed you as far as we were able. The Tin Woodman and the"
55 "Scarecrow are destroyed, and the Lion is tied up in your yard. The"
55 "little girl we dare not harm, nor the dog she carries in her arms. Your"
55 "power over our band is now ended, and you will never see us again.”"
55 ""
55 "Then all the Winged Monkeys, with much laughing and chattering and"
55 "noise, flew into the air and were soon out of sight."
55 ""
55 "The Wicked Witch was both surprised and worried when she saw the mark"
55 "on Dorothy’s forehead, for she knew well that neither the Winged"
55 "Monkeys nor she, herself, dare hurt the girl in any way. She looked"
55 "down at Dorothy’s feet, and seeing the Silver Shoes, began to tremble"
55 "with fear, for she knew what a powerful charm belonged to them. At"
55 "first the Witch was tempted to run away from Dorothy; but she happened"
55 "to look into the child’s eyes and saw how simple the soul behind them"
55 "was, and that the little girl did not know of the wonderful power the"
55 "Silver Shoes gave her. So the Wicked Witch laughed to herself, and"
55 "thought, “I can still make her my slave, for she does not know how to"
55 "use her power.” Then she said to Dorothy, harshly and severely:"
55 ""
55 "“Come with me; and see that you mind everything I tell you, for if you"
55 "do not I will make an end of you, as I did of the Tin Woodman and the"
55 "Scarecrow.”"
55 ""
55 "Dorothy followed her through many of the beautiful rooms in her castle"
55 "until they came to the kitchen, where the Witch bade her clean the pots"
55 "and kettles and sweep the floor and keep the fire fed with wood."
55 ""
55 "Dorothy went to work meekly, with her mind made up to work as hard as"
55 "she could; for she was glad the Wicked Witch had decided not to kill"
55 "her."
55 ""
55 "With Dorothy hard at work, the Witch thought she would go into the"
55 "courtyard and harness the Cowardly Lion like a horse; it would amuse"
55 "her, she was sure, to make him draw her chariot whenever she wished to"
55 "go to drive. But as she opened the gate the Lion gave a loud roar and"
55 "bounded at her so fiercely that the Witch was afraid, and ran out and"
55 "shut the gate again."
55 ""
55 "“If I cannot harness you,” said the Witch to the Lion, speaking through"
55 "the bars of the gate, “I can starve you. You shall have nothing to eat"
55 "until you do as I wish.”"
55 ""
55 "So after that she took no food to the imprisoned Lion; but every day"
55 "she came to the gate at noon and asked, “Are you ready to be harnessed"
55 "like a horse?”"
55 ""
55 "And the Lion would answer, “No. If you come in this yard, I will bite"
55 "you.”"
55 ""
55 "The reason the Lion did not have to do as the Witch wished was that"
55 "every night, while the woman was asleep, Dorothy carried him food from"
55 "the cupboard. After he had eaten he would lie down on his bed of straw,"
55 "and Dorothy would lie beside him and put her head on his soft, shaggy"
55 "mane, while they talked of their troubles and tried to plan some way to"
55 "escape. But they could find no way to get out of the castle, for it was"
55 "constantly guarded by the yellow Winkies, who were the slaves of the"
55 "Wicked Witch and too afraid of her not to do as she told them."
55 ""
55 "The girl had to work hard during the day, and often the Witch"
55 "threatened to beat her with the same old umbrella she always carried in"
55 "her hand. But, in truth, she did not dare to strike Dorothy, because of"
55 "the mark upon her forehead. The child did not know this, and was full"
55 "of fear for herself and Toto. Once the Witch struck Toto a blow with"
55 "her umbrella and the brave little dog flew at her and bit her leg in"
55 "return. The Witch did not bleed where she was bitten, for she was so"
55 "wicked that the blood in her had dried up many years before."
55 ""
55 "Dorothy’s life became very sad as she grew to understand that it would"
55 "be harder than ever to get back to Kansas and Aunt Em again. Sometimes"
55 "she would cry bitterly for hours, with Toto sitting at her feet and"
55 "looking into her face, whining dismally to show how sorry he was for"
55 "his little mistress. Toto did not really care whether he was in Kansas"
55 "or the Land of Oz so long as Dorothy was with him; but he knew the"
55 "little girl was unhappy, and that made him unhappy too."
55 ""
55 "Now the Wicked Witch had a great longing to have for her own the Silver"
55 "Shoes which the girl always wore. Her bees and her crows and her wolves"
55 "were lying in heaps and drying up, and she had used up all the power of"
55 "the Golden Cap; but if she could only get hold of the Silver Shoes,"
55 "they would give her more power than all the other things she had lost."
55 "She watched Dorothy carefully, to see if she ever took off her shoes,"
55 "thinking she might steal them. But the child was so proud of her pretty"
55 "shoes that she never took them off except at night and when she took"
55 "her bath. The Witch was too much afraid of the dark to dare go in"
55 "Dorothy’s room at night to take the shoes, and her dread of water was"
55 "greater than her fear of the dark, so she never came near when Dorothy"
55 "was bathing. Indeed, the old Witch never touched water, nor ever let"
55 "water touch her in any way."
55 ""
55 "But the wicked creature was very cunning, and she finally thought of a"
55 "trick that would give her what she wanted. She placed a bar of iron in"
55 "the middle of the kitchen floor, and then by her magic arts made the"
55 "iron invisible to human eyes. So that when Dorothy walked across the"
55 "floor she stumbled over the bar, not being able to see it, and fell at"
55 "full length. She was not much hurt, but in her fall one of the Silver"
55 "Shoes came off; and before she could reach it, the Witch had snatched"
55 "it away and put it on her own skinny foot."
55 ""
55 "The wicked woman was greatly pleased with the success of her trick, for"
55 "as long as she had one of the shoes she owned half the power of their"
55 "charm, and Dorothy could not use it against her, even had she known how"
55 "to do so."
55 ""
55 "The little girl, seeing she had lost one of her pretty shoes, grew"
55 "angry, and said to the Witch, “Give me back my shoe!”"
55 ""
55 "“I will not,” retorted the Witch, “for it is now my shoe, and not"
55 "yours.”"
55 ""
55 "“You are a wicked creature!” cried Dorothy. “You have no right to take"
55 "my shoe from me.”"
55 ""
55 "“I shall keep it, just the same,” said the Witch, laughing at her, “and"
55 "someday I shall get the other one from you, too.”"
55 ""
55 "This made Dorothy so very angry that she picked up the bucket of water"
55 "that stood near and dashed it over the Witch, wetting her from head to"
55 "foot."
55 ""
55 "Instantly the wicked woman gave a loud cry of fear, and then, as"
55 "Dorothy looked at her in wonder, the Witch began to shrink and fall"
55 "away."
55 ""
55 "“See what you have done!” she screamed. “In a minute I shall melt"
55 "away.”"
55 ""
55 "“I’m very sorry, indeed,” said Dorothy, who was truly frightened to see"
55 "the Witch actually melting away like brown sugar before her very eyes."
55 ""
55 "“Didn’t you know water would be the end of me?” asked the Witch, in a"
55 "wailing, despairing voice."
55 ""
55 "“Of course not,” answered Dorothy. “How should I?”"
55 ""
55 "“Well, in a few minutes I shall be all melted, and you will have the"
55 "castle to yourself. I have been wicked in my day, but I never thought a"
55 "little girl like you would ever be able to melt me and end my wicked"
55 "deeds. Look out—here I go!”"
55 ""
55 "With these words the Witch fell down in a brown, melted, shapeless mass"
55 "and began to spread over the clean boards of the kitchen floor. Seeing"
55 "that she had really melted away to nothing, Dorothy drew another bucket"
55 "of water and threw it over the mess. She then swept it all out the"
55 "door. After picking out the silver shoe, which was all that was left of"
55 "the old woman, she cleaned and dried it with a cloth, and put it on her"
55 "foot again. Then, being at last free to do as she chose, she ran out to"
55 "the courtyard to tell the Lion that the Wicked Witch of the West had"
55 "come to an end, and that they were no longer prisoners in a strange"
55 "land."

55 "<Chapter XIII"
55 "The Rescue>"
55 ""
55 ""
55 "The Cowardly Lion was much pleased to hear that the Wicked Witch had"
55 "been melted by a bucket of water, and Dorothy at once unlocked the gate"
55 "of his prison and set him free. They went in together to the castle,"
55 "where Dorothy’s first act was to call all the Winkies together and tell"
55 "them that they were no longer slaves."
55 ""
55 "There was great rejoicing among the yellow Winkies, for they had been"
55 "made to work hard during many years for the Wicked Witch, who had"
55 "always treated them with great cruelty. They kept this day as a"
55 "holiday, then and ever after, and spent the time in feasting and"
55 "dancing."
55 ""
55 "“If our friends, the Scarecrow and the Tin Woodman, were only with us,”"
55 "said the Lion, “I should be quite happy.”"
55 ""
55 "“Don’t you suppose we could rescue them?” asked the girl anxiously."
55 ""
55 "“We can try,” answered the Lion."
55 ""
55 "So they called the yellow Winkies and asked them if they would help to"
55 "rescue their friends, and the Winkies said that they would be delighted"
55 "to do all in their power for Dorothy, who had set them free from"
55 "bondage. So she chose a number of the Winkies who looked as if they"
55 "knew the most, and they all started away. They traveled that day and"
55 "part of the next until they came to the rocky plain where the Tin"
55 "Woodman lay, all battered and bent. His axe was near him, but the blade"
55 "was rusted and the handle broken off short."
55 ""
55 "The Winkies lifted him tenderly in their arms, and carried him back to"
55 "the Yellow Castle again, Dorothy shedding a few tears by the way at the"
55 "sad plight of her old friend, and the Lion looking sober and sorry."
55 "When they reached the castle Dorothy said to the Winkies:"
55 ""
55 "“Are any of your people tinsmiths?”"
55 ""
55 "“Oh, yes. Some of us are very good tinsmiths,” they told her."
55 ""
55 "“Then bring them to me,” she said. And when the tinsmiths came,"
55 "bringing with them all their tools in baskets, she inquired, “Can you"
55 "straighten out those dents in the Tin Woodman, and bend him back into"
55 "shape again, and solder him together where he is broken?”"
55 ""
55 "The tinsmiths looked the Woodman over carefully and then answered that"
55 "they thought they could mend him so he would be as good as ever. So"
55 "they set to work in one of the big yellow rooms of the castle and"
55 "worked for three days and four nights, hammering and twisting and"
55 "bending and soldering and polishing and pounding at the legs and body"
55 "and head of the Tin Woodman, until at last he was straightened out into"
55 "his old form, and his joints worked as well as ever. To be sure, there"
55 "were several patches on him, but the tinsmiths did a good job, and as"
55 "the Woodman was not a vain man he did not mind the patches at all."
55 ""
55 "When, at last, he walked into Dorothy’s room and thanked her for"
55 "rescuing him, he was so pleased that he wept tears of joy, and Dorothy"
55 "had to wipe every tear carefully from his face with her apron, so his"
55 "joints would not be rusted. At the same time her own tears fell thick"
55 "and fast at the joy of meeting her old friend again, and these tears"

55 "often with the tip of his tail that it became quite wet, and he was"

55 "“If we only had the Scarecrow with us again,” said the Tin Woodman,"

55 "Now while the tinsmiths had been at work mending the Woodman himself,"
55 "another of the Winkies, who was a goldsmith, had made an axe-handle of"

55 "broken handle. Others polished the blade until all the rust was removed"
55 "and it glistened like burnished silver."

55 "As soon as he had spoken, the Tin Woodman began to chop, and in a short"
55 "time the tree fell over with a crash, whereupon the Scarecrow’s clothes"
55 "fell out of the branches and rolled off on the ground."

55 "Dorothy picked them up and had the Winkies carry them back to the"

55 "Now that they were reunited, Dorothy and her friends spent a few happy"

55 "“Oh, let us start for the Emerald City tomorrow!”"
55 ""
55 "This they decided to do. The next day they called the Winkies together"
55 "and bade them good-bye. The Winkies were sorry to have them go, and"
55 "they had grown so fond of the Tin Woodman that they begged him to stay"
55 "and rule over them and the Yellow Land of the West. Finding they were"
55 "determined to go, the Winkies gave Toto and the Lion each a golden"
55 "collar; and to Dorothy they presented a beautiful bracelet studded with"
55 "diamonds; and to the Scarecrow they gave a gold-headed walking stick,"
55 "to keep him from stumbling; and to the Tin Woodman they offered a"
55 "silver oil-can, inlaid with gold and set with precious jewels."
55 ""
55 "Every one of the travelers made the Winkies a pretty speech in return,"
55 "and all shook hands with them until their arms ached."
55 ""
55 "Dorothy went to the Witch’s cupboard to fill her basket with food for"
55 "the journey, and there she saw the Golden Cap. She tried it on her own"
55 "head and found that it fitted her exactly. She did not know anything"
55 "about the charm of the Golden Cap, but she saw that it was pretty, so"
55 "she made up her mind to wear it and carry her sunbonnet in the basket."

55 "You will remember there was no road—not even a pathway—between the"
55 "castle of the Wicked Witch and the Emerald City. When the four"
55 "travelers went in search of the Witch she had seen them coming, and so"
55 "sent the Winged Monkeys to bring them to her. It was much harder to"
55 "find their way back through the big fields of buttercups and yellow"
55 "daisies than it was being carried. They knew, of course, they must go"
55 "straight east, toward the rising sun; and they started off in the right"
55 "way. But at noon, when the sun was over their heads, they did not know"
55 "which was east and which was west, and that was the reason they were"
55 "lost in the great fields. They kept on walking, however, and at night"
55 "the moon came out and shone brightly. So they lay down among the sweet"
55 "smelling yellow flowers and slept soundly until morning—all but the"
55 "Scarecrow and the Tin Woodman."
55 ""
55 "The next morning the sun was behind a cloud, but they started on, as if"
55 "they were quite sure which way they were going."

55 "“If we walk far enough,” said Dorothy, “I am sure we shall sometime"
55 "come to some place.”"
55 ""
55 "But day by day passed away, and they still saw nothing before them but"
55 "the scarlet fields. The Scarecrow began to grumble a bit."
55 ""
55 "“We have surely lost our way,” he said, “and unless we find it again in"
55 "time to reach the Emerald City, I shall never get my brains.”"
55 ""
55 "“Nor I my heart,” declared the Tin Woodman. “It seems to me I can"
55 "scarcely wait till I get to Oz, and you must admit this is a very long"
55 "journey.”"

55 "“You see,” said the Cowardly Lion, with a whimper, “I haven’t the"
55 "courage to keep tramping forever, without getting anywhere at all.”"

55 "Then Dorothy lost heart. She sat down on the grass and looked at her"
55 "companions, and they sat down and looked at her, and Toto found that"
55 "for the first time in his life he was too tired to chase a butterfly"
55 "that flew past his head. So he put out his tongue and panted and looked"
55 "at Dorothy as if to ask what they should do next."
55 ""
55 "“Suppose we call the field mice,” she suggested. “They could probably"
55 "tell us the way to the Emerald City.”"

55 "“To be sure they could,” cried the Scarecrow. “Why didn’t we think of"
55 "that before?”"

55 "Dorothy blew the little whistle she had always carried about her neck"
55 "since the Queen of the Mice had given it to her. In a few minutes they"
55 "heard the pattering of tiny feet, and many of the small gray mice came"
55 "running up to her. Among them was the Queen herself, who asked, in her"
55 "squeaky little voice:"
55 ""
55 "“What can I do for my friends?”"
55 ""
55 "“We have lost our way,” said Dorothy. “Can you tell us where the"

55 ""
55 "“Certainly,” answered the Queen; “but it is a great way off, for you"
55 "have had it at your backs all this time.” Then she noticed Dorothy’s"
55 "Golden Cap, and said, “Why don’t you use the charm of the Cap, and call"
55 "the Winged Monkeys to you? They will carry you to the City of Oz in"
55 "less than an hour.”"
55 ""
55 "“I didn’t know there was a charm,” answered Dorothy, in surprise. “What"
55 "is it?”"
55 ""
55 "“It is written inside the Golden Cap,” replied the Queen of the Mice."
55 "“But if you are going to call the Winged Monkeys we must run away, for"
55 "they are full of mischief and think it great fun to plague us.”"
55 ""
55 "“Won’t they hurt me?” asked the girl anxiously."
55 ""
55 "“Oh, no. They must obey the wearer of the Cap. Good-bye!” And she"
55 "scampered out of sight, with all the mice hurrying after her."
55 ""
55 "Dorothy looked inside the Golden Cap and saw some words written upon"
55 "the lining. These, she thought, must be the charm, so she read the"
55 "directions carefully and put the Cap upon her head."

55 "“Ep-pe, pep-pe, kak-ke!” she said, standing on her left foot."

55 ""
55 "“Ziz-zy, zuz-zy, zik!” said Dorothy, who was now standing on both feet."
55 "This ended the saying of the charm, and they heard a great chattering"
55 "and flapping of wings, as the band of Winged Monkeys flew up to them."

55 "The King bowed low before Dorothy, and asked, “What is your command?”"
55 ""
55 "“We wish to go to the Emerald City,” said the child, “and we have lost"
55 "our way.”"
55 ""
55 "“We will carry you,” replied the King, and no sooner had he spoken than"
55 "two of the Monkeys caught Dorothy in their arms and flew away with her."
55 "Others took the Scarecrow and the Woodman and the Lion, and one little"
55 "Monkey seized Toto and flew after them, although the dog tried hard to"
55 "bite him."
55 ""
55 "The Scarecrow and the Tin Woodman were rather frightened at first, for"
55 "they remembered how badly the Winged Monkeys had treated them before;"
55 "but they saw that no harm was intended, so they rode through the air"
55 "quite cheerfully, and had a fine time looking at the pretty gardens and"
55 "woods far below them."
55 ""
55 "Dorothy found herself riding easily between two of the biggest Monkeys,"
55 "one of them the King himself. They had made a chair of their hands and"
55 "were careful not to hurt her."

55 ""
55 "“That is a long story,” answered the King, with a winged laugh; “but as"
55 "we have a long journey before us, I will pass the time by telling you"
55 "about it, if you wish.”"
55 ""
55 "“I shall be glad to hear it,” she replied."
55 ""
55 "“Once,” began the leader, “we were a free people, living happily in the"
55 "great forest, flying from tree to tree, eating nuts and fruit, and"
55 "doing just as we pleased without calling anybody master. Perhaps some"
55 "of us were rather too full of mischief at times, flying down to pull"
55 "the tails of the animals that had no wings, chasing birds, and throwing"
55 "nuts at the people who walked in the forest. But we were careless and"
55 "happy and full of fun, and enjoyed every minute of the day. This was"
55 "many years ago, long before Oz came out of the clouds to rule over this"
55 "land."
55 ""
55 "“There lived here then, away at the North, a beautiful princess, who"
55 "was also a powerful sorceress. All her magic was used to help the"
55 "people, and she was never known to hurt anyone who was good. Her name"
55 "was Gayelette, and she lived in a handsome palace built from great"
55 "blocks of ruby. Everyone loved her, but her greatest sorrow was that"
55 "she could find no one to love in return, since all the men were much"
55 "too stupid and ugly to mate with one so beautiful and wise. At last,"
55 "however, she found a boy who was handsome and manly and wise beyond his"
55 "years. Gayelette made up her mind that when he grew to be a man she"
55 "would make him her husband, so she took him to her ruby palace and used"
55 "all her magic powers to make him as strong and good and lovely as any"
55 "woman could wish. When he grew to manhood, Quelala, as he was called,"
55 "was said to be the best and wisest man in all the land, while his manly"
55 "beauty was so great that Gayelette loved him dearly, and hastened to"
55 "make everything ready for the wedding."
55 ""
55 "“My grandfather was at that time the King of the Winged Monkeys which"
55 "lived in the forest near Gayelette’s palace, and the old fellow loved a"
55 "joke better than a good dinner. One day, just before the wedding, my"
55 "grandfather was flying out with his band when he saw Quelala walking"
55 "beside the river. He was dressed in a rich costume of pink silk and"
55 "purple velvet, and my grandfather thought he would see what he could"
55 "do. At his word the band flew down and seized Quelala, carried him in"
55 "their arms until they were over the middle of the river, and then"
55 "dropped him into the water."

55 "“‘Swim out, my fine fellow,’ cried my grandfather, ‘and see if the"
55 "water has spotted your clothes.’ Quelala was much too wise not to swim,"

55 "laughed, when he came to the top of the water, and swam in to shore."
55 "But when Gayelette came running out to him she found his silks and"
55 "velvet all ruined by the river."

55 "“The princess was angry, and she knew, of course, who did it. She had"
55 "all the Winged Monkeys brought before her, and she said at first that"

55 "treated Quelala, and dropped in the river. But my grandfather pleaded"
55 "hard, for he knew the Monkeys would drown in the river with their wings"
55 "tied, and Quelala said a kind word for them also; so that Gayelette"
55 "finally spared them, on condition that the Winged Monkeys should ever"
55 "after do three times the bidding of the owner of the Golden Cap. This"
55 "Cap had been made for a wedding present to Quelala, and it is said to"
55 "have cost the princess half her kingdom. Of course my grandfather and"
55 "all the other Monkeys at once agreed to the condition, and that is how"
55 "it happens that we are three times the slaves of the owner of the"
55 "Golden Cap, whosoever he may be.”"

55 "“And what became of them?” asked Dorothy, who had been greatly"
55 "interested in the story."
55 ""
55 "“Quelala being the first owner of the Golden Cap,” replied the Monkey,"
55 "“he was the first to lay his wishes upon us. As his bride could not"
55 "bear the sight of us, he called us all to him in the forest after he"
55 "had married her and ordered us always to keep where she could never"
55 "again set eyes on a Winged Monkey, which we were glad to do, for we"

55 "“This was all we ever had to do until the Golden Cap fell into the"

55 "“No, but it’s farther from here,” he said, shaking his head at her"
55 "sadly. “When I grew up I became a ventriloquist, and at that I was very"
55 "well trained by a great master. I can imitate any kind of a bird or"
55 "beast.” Here he mewed so like a kitten that Toto pricked up his ears"
55 "and looked everywhere to see where she was. “After a time,” continued"
55 "Oz, “I tired of that, and became a balloonist.”"
55 ""
55 "“What is that?” asked Dorothy."
55 ""
55 "“A man who goes up in a balloon on circus day, so as to draw a crowd of"
55 "people together and get them to pay to see the circus,” he explained."
55 ""
55 "“Oh,” she said, “I know.”"
55 ""
55 "“Well, one day I went up in a balloon and the ropes got twisted, so"
55 "that I couldn’t come down again. It went way up above the clouds, so"
55 "far that a current of air struck it and carried it many, many miles"
55 "away. For a day and a night I traveled through the air, and on the"
55 "morning of the second day I awoke and found the balloon floating over a"
55 "strange and beautiful country."
55 ""
55 "“It came down gradually, and I was not hurt a bit. But I found myself"
55 "in the midst of a strange people, who, seeing me come from the clouds,"
55 "thought I was a great Wizard. Of course I let them think so, because"
55 "they were afraid of me, and promised to do anything I wished them to."
55 ""
55 "“Just to amuse myself, and keep the good people busy, I ordered them to"
55 "build this City, and my Palace; and they did it all willingly and well."
55 "Then I thought, as the country was so green and beautiful, I would call"
55 "it the Emerald City; and to make the name fit better I put green"
55 "spectacles on all the people, so that everything they saw was green.”"
55 ""
55 "“But isn’t everything here green?” asked Dorothy."
55 ""
55 "“No more than in any other city,” replied Oz; “but when you wear green"
55 "spectacles, why of course everything you see looks green to you. The"
55 "Emerald City was built a great many years ago, for I was a young man"
55 "when the balloon brought me here, and I am a very old man now. But my"
55 "people have worn green glasses on their eyes so long that most of them"
55 "think it really is an Emerald City, and it certainly is a beautiful"
55 "place, abounding in jewels and precious metals, and every good thing"
55 "that is needed to make one happy. I have been good to the people, and"
55 "they like me; but ever since this Palace was built, I have shut myself"
55 "up and would not see any of them."
55 ""
55 "“One of my greatest fears was the Witches, for while I had no magical"
55 "powers at all I soon found out that the Witches were really able to do"
55 "wonderful things. There were four of them in this country, and they"
55 "ruled the people who live in the North and South and East and West."
55 "Fortunately, the Witches of the North and South were good, and I knew"
55 "they would do me no harm; but the Witches of the East and West were"
55 "terribly wicked, and had they not thought I was more powerful than they"
55 "themselves, they would surely have destroyed me. As it was, I lived in"
55 "deadly fear of them for many years; so you can imagine how pleased I"
55 "was when I heard your house had fallen on the Wicked Witch of the East."
55 "When you came to me, I was willing to promise anything if you would"
55 "only do away with the other Witch; but, now that you have melted her, I"

55 ""
55 "“You have plenty of courage, I am sure,” answered Oz. “All you need is"
55 "confidence in yourself. There is no living thing that is not afraid"
55 "when it faces danger. The True courage is in facing danger when you are"
55 "afraid, and that kind of courage you have in plenty.”"

55 "two or three days to consider the matter and I’ll try to find a way to"
55 "carry you over the desert. In the meantime you shall all be treated as"
55 "my guests, and while you live in the Palace my people will wait upon"
55 "you and obey your slightest wish. There is only one thing I ask in"
55 "return for my help—such as it is. You must keep my secret and tell no"
55 "one I am a humbug.”"
55 ""
55 "They agreed to say nothing of what they had learned, and went back to"
55 "their rooms in high spirits. Even Dorothy had hope that “The Great and"

55 "“It is kind of you to like a Scarecrow,” he replied. “But surely you"

55 ""
55 "“Come in,” said Oz."

55 "The Scarecrow went in and found the little man sitting down by the"

55 "“Oh, yes; sit down in that chair, please,” replied Oz. “You must excuse"

55 ""
55 "“That’s all right,” said the Scarecrow. “You are quite welcome to take"
55 "my head off, as long as it will be a better one when you put it on"
55 "again.”"
55 ""
55 "So the Wizard unfastened his head and emptied out the straw. Then he"
55 "entered the back room and took up a measure of bran, which he mixed"
55 "with a great many pins and needles. Having shaken them together"
55 "thoroughly, he filled the top of the Scarecrow’s head with the mixture"
55 "and stuffed the rest of the space with straw, to hold it in place."
55 ""
55 "When he had fastened the Scarecrow’s head on his body again he said to"
55 "him, “Hereafter you will be a great man, for I have given you a lot of"
55 "bran-new brains.”"

55 "The Scarecrow was both pleased and proud at the fulfillment of his"
55 "greatest wish, and having thanked Oz warmly he went back to his"

55 ""
55 "“How do you feel?” she asked."
55 ""
55 "“I feel wise indeed,” he answered earnestly. “When I get used to my"

55 ""
55 "“Why are those needles and pins sticking out of your head?” asked the"
55 "Tin Woodman."
55 ""
55 "“That is proof that he is sharp,” remarked the Lion."
55 ""
55 "“Well, I must go to Oz and get my heart,” said the Woodman. So he"
55 "walked to the Throne Room and knocked at the door."
55 ""
55 "“Come in,” called Oz, and the Woodman entered and said, “I have come"
55 "for my heart.”"

55 "won’t hurt you.”"
55 ""
55 "“Oh, no,” answered the Woodman. “I shall not feel it at all.”"
55 ""
55 "So Oz brought a pair of tinsmith’s shears and cut a small, square hole"
55 "in the left side of the Tin Woodman’s breast. Then, going to a chest of"
55 "drawers, he took out a pretty heart, made entirely of silk and stuffed"
55 "with sawdust."
55 ""
55 "“Isn’t it a beauty?” he asked."
55 ""
55 "“It is, indeed!” replied the Woodman, who was greatly pleased. “But is"
55 "it a kind heart?”"
55 ""
55 "“Oh, very!” answered Oz. He put the heart in the Woodman’s breast and"
55 "then replaced the square of tin, soldering it neatly together where it"
55 "had been cut."
55 ""
55 "“There,” said he; “now you have a heart that any man might be proud of."
55 "I’m sorry I had to put a patch on your breast, but it really couldn’t"

55 "sniffed at it as if he did not like it, the Wizard said:"
55 ""
55 "“Drink.”"
55 ""
55 "“What is it?” asked the Lion."
55 ""
55 "“Well,” answered Oz, “if it were inside of you, it would be courage."

55 "people make me do things that everybody knows can’t be done? It was"
55 "easy to make the Scarecrow and the Lion and the Woodman happy, because"

55 "contented. The Scarecrow told them there were wonderful thoughts in his"
55 "head; but he would not say what they were because he knew no one could"
55 "understand them but himself. When the Tin Woodman walked about he felt"
55 "his heart rattling around in his breast; and he told Dorothy he had"
55 "discovered it to be a kinder and more tender heart than the one he had"
55 "owned when he was made of flesh. The Lion declared he was afraid of"

55 "entered the Throne Room he greeted her pleasantly:"
55 ""
55 "“Sit down, my dear; I think I have found the way to get you out of this"

55 "“And back to Kansas?” she asked eagerly."
55 ""
55 "“Well, I’m not sure about Kansas,” said Oz, “for I haven’t the faintest"
55 "notion which way it lies. But the first thing to do is to cross the"
55 "desert, and then it should be easy to find your way home.”"
55 ""
55 "“How can I cross the desert?” she inquired."
55 ""
55 "“Well, I’ll tell you what I think,” said the little man. “You see, when"
55 "I came to this country it was in a balloon. You also came through the"
55 "air, being carried by a cyclone. So I believe the best way to get"
55 "across the desert will be through the air. Now, it is quite beyond my"
55 "powers to make a cyclone; but I’ve been thinking the matter over, and I"
55 "believe I can make a balloon.”"
55 ""
55 "“How?” asked Dorothy."
55 ""
55 "“A balloon,” said Oz, “is made of silk, which is coated with glue to"
55 "keep the gas in it. I have plenty of silk in the Palace, so it will be"
55 "no trouble to make the balloon. But in all this country there is no gas"
55 "to fill the balloon with, to make it float.”"
55 ""
55 "“If it won’t float,” remarked Dorothy, “it will be of no use to us.”"
55 ""
55 "“True,” answered Oz. “But there is another way to make it float, which"
55 "is to fill it with hot air. Hot air isn’t as good as gas, for if the"
55 "air should get cold the balloon would come down in the desert, and we"
55 "should be lost.”"
55 ""
55 "“We!” exclaimed the girl. “Are you going with me?”"
55 ""
55 "“Yes, of course,” replied Oz. “I am tired of being such a humbug. If I"
55 "should go out of this Palace my people would soon discover I am not a"
55 "Wizard, and then they would be vexed with me for having deceived them."
55 "So I have to stay shut up in these rooms all day, and it gets tiresome."
55 "I’d much rather go back to Kansas with you and be in a circus again.”"
55 ""
55 "“I shall be glad to have your company,” said Dorothy."
55 ""
55 "“Thank you,” he answered. “Now, if you will help me sew the silk"
55 "together, we will begin to work on our balloon.”"
55 ""
55 "So Dorothy took a needle and thread, and as fast as Oz cut the strips"
55 "of silk into proper shape the girl sewed them neatly together. First"
55 "there was a strip of light green silk, then a strip of dark green and"
55 "then a strip of emerald green; for Oz had a fancy to make the balloon"
55 "in different shades of the color about them. It took three days to sew"
55 "all the strips together, but when it was finished they had a big bag of"
55 "green silk more than twenty feet long."
55 ""
55 "Then Oz painted it on the inside with a coat of thin glue, to make it"
55 "airtight, after which he announced that the balloon was ready."
55 ""
55 "“But we must have a basket to ride in,” he said. So he sent the soldier"
55 "with the green whiskers for a big clothes basket, which he fastened"
55 "with many ropes to the bottom of the balloon."

55 "When it was all ready, Oz sent word to his people that he was going to"
55 "make a visit to a great brother Wizard who lived in the clouds. The"
55 "news spread rapidly throughout the city and everyone came to see the"
55 "wonderful sight."
55 ""
55 "Oz ordered the balloon carried out in front of the Palace, and the"
55 "people gazed upon it with much curiosity. The Tin Woodman had chopped a"
55 "big pile of wood, and now he made a fire of it, and Oz held the bottom"
55 "of the balloon over the fire so that the hot air that arose from it"
55 "would be caught in the silken bag. Gradually the balloon swelled out"
55 "and rose into the air, until finally the basket just touched the"
55 "ground."
55 ""
55 "Then Oz got into the basket and said to all the people in a loud voice:"
55 ""
55 "“I am now going away to make a visit. While I am gone the Scarecrow"
55 "will rule over you. I command you to obey him as you would me.”"
55 ""
55 "The balloon was by this time tugging hard at the rope that held it to"
55 "the ground, for the air within it was hot, and this made it so much"
55 "lighter in weight than the air without that it pulled hard to rise into"
55 "the sky."
55 ""
55 "“Come, Dorothy!” cried the Wizard. “Hurry up, or the balloon will fly"
55 "away.”"
55 ""
55 "“I can’t find Toto anywhere,” replied Dorothy, who did not wish to"
55 "leave her little dog behind. Toto had run into the crowd to bark at a"
55 "kitten, and Dorothy at last found him. She picked him up and ran"

55 "She was within a few steps of it, and Oz was holding out his hands to"

55 "And that was the last any of them ever saw of Oz, the Wonderful Wizard,"
55 "though he may have reached Omaha safely, and be there now, for all we"

55 "“Let us call in the soldier with the green whiskers,” he said, “and ask"
55 "his advice.”"
55 ""
55 "So the soldier was summoned and entered the Throne Room timidly, for"
55 "while Oz was alive he never was allowed to come farther than the door."
55 ""
55 "“This little girl,” said the Scarecrow to the soldier, “wishes to cross"
55 "the desert. How can she do so?”"
55 ""
55 "“I cannot tell,” answered the soldier, “for nobody has ever crossed the"
55 "desert, unless it is Oz himself.”"

55 "“Is there no one who can help me?” asked Dorothy earnestly."
55 ""
55 "“Glinda might,” he suggested."
55 ""
55 "“Who is Glinda?” inquired the Scarecrow."
55 ""
55 "“The Witch of the South. She is the most powerful of all the Witches,"
55 "and rules over the Quadlings. Besides, her castle stands on the edge of"
55 "the desert, so she may know a way to cross it.”"
55 ""
55 "“Glinda is a Good Witch, isn’t she?” asked the child."
55 ""
55 "“The Quadlings think she is good,” said the soldier, “and she is kind"
55 "to everyone. I have heard that Glinda is a beautiful woman, who knows"
55 "how to keep young in spite of the many years she has lived.”"
55 ""
55 "“How can I get to her castle?” asked Dorothy."
55 ""
55 "“The road is straight to the South,” he answered, “but it is said to be"
55 "full of dangers to travelers. There are wild beasts in the woods, and a"
55 "race of queer men who do not like strangers to cross their country. For"
55 "this reason none of the Quadlings ever come to the Emerald City.”"
55 ""
55 "The soldier then left them and the Scarecrow said:"
55 ""
55 "“It seems, in spite of dangers, that the best thing Dorothy can do is"
55 "to travel to the Land of the South and ask Glinda to help her. For, of"
55 "course, if Dorothy stays here she will never get back to Kansas.”"
55 ""
55 "“You must have been thinking again,” remarked the Tin Woodman."
55 ""
55 "“I have,” said the Scarecrow."
55 ""
55 "“I shall go with Dorothy,” declared the Lion, “for I am tired of your"
55 "city and long for the woods and the country again. I am really a wild"
55 "beast, you know. Besides, Dorothy will need someone to protect her.”"
55 ""
55 "“That is true,” agreed the Woodman. “My axe may be of service to her;"
55 "so I also will go with her to the Land of the South.”"
55 ""
55 "“When shall we start?” asked the Scarecrow."
55 ""
55 "“Are you going?” they asked, in surprise."
55 ""
55 "“Certainly. If it wasn’t for Dorothy I should never have had brains."
55 "She lifted me from the pole in the cornfield and brought me to the"
55 "Emerald City. So my good luck is all due to her, and I shall never"
55 "leave her until she starts back to Kansas for good and all.”"
55 ""
55 "“Thank you,” said Dorothy gratefully. “You are all very kind to me. But"
55 "I should like to start as soon as possible.”"
55 ""
55 "“We shall go tomorrow morning,” returned the Scarecrow. “So now let us"
55 "all get ready, for it will be a long journey.”"

55 "The next morning Dorothy kissed the pretty green girl good-bye, and"
55 "they all shook hands with the soldier with the green whiskers, who had"
55 "walked with them as far as the gate. When the Guardian of the Gate saw"
55 "them again he wondered greatly that they could leave the beautiful City"
55 "to get into new trouble. But he at once unlocked their spectacles,"
55 "which he put back into the green box, and gave them many good wishes to"
55 "carry with them."

55 "been good to me. I cannot tell you how grateful I am.”"
55 ""
55 "“Don’t try, my dear,” he answered. “We should like to keep you with us,"
55 "but if it is your wish to return to Kansas, I hope you will find a"
55 "way.” He then opened the gate of the outer wall, and they walked forth"
55 "and started upon their journey."
55 ""
55 "The sun shone brightly as our friends turned their faces toward the"
55 "Land of the South. They were all in the best of spirits, and laughed"
55 "and chatted together. Dorothy was once more filled with the hope of"
55 "getting home, and the Scarecrow and the Tin Woodman were glad to be of"
55 "use to her. As for the Lion, he sniffed the fresh air with delight and"
55 "whisked his tail from side to side in pure joy at being in the country"
55 "again, while Toto ran around them and chased the moths and butterflies,"
55 "barking merrily all the time."

55 "“City life does not agree with me at all,” remarked the Lion, as they"
55 "walked along at a brisk pace. “I have lost much flesh since I lived"
55 "there, and now I am anxious for a chance to show the other beasts how"
55 "courageous I have grown.”"
55 ""
55 "They now turned and took a last look at the Emerald City. All they"
55 "could see was a mass of towers and steeples behind the green walls, and"
55 "high up above everything the spires and dome of the Palace of Oz."
55 ""
55 "“Oz was not such a bad Wizard, after all,” said the Tin Woodman, as he"
55 "felt his heart rattling around in his breast."

55 "Scarecrow."
55 ""
55 "“If Oz had taken a dose of the same courage he gave me,” added the"
55 "Lion, “he would have been a brave man.”"
55 ""
55 "Dorothy said nothing. Oz had not kept the promise he made her, but he"
55 "had done his best, so she forgave him. As he said, he was a good man,"
55 "even if he was a bad Wizard."
55 ""
55 "The first day’s journey was through the green fields and bright flowers"
55 "that stretched about the Emerald City on every side. They slept that"
55 "night on the grass, with nothing but the stars over them; and they"
55 "rested very well indeed."
55 ""
55 "In the morning they traveled on until they came to a thick wood. There"
55 "was no way of going around it, for it seemed to extend to the right and"
55 "left as far as they could see; and, besides, they did not dare change"
55 "the direction of their journey for fear of getting lost. So they looked"
55 "for the place where it would be easiest to get into the forest."
55 ""
55 "The Scarecrow, who was in the lead, finally discovered a big tree with"
55 "such wide-spreading branches that there was room for the party to pass"
55 "underneath. So he walked forward to the tree, but just as he came under"
55 "the first branches they bent down and twined around him, and the next"
55 "minute he was raised from the ground and flung headlong among his"
55 "fellow travelers."
55 ""
55 "This did not hurt the Scarecrow, but it surprised him, and he looked"
55 "rather dizzy when Dorothy picked him up."
55 ""
55 "“Here is another space between the trees,” called the Lion."
55 ""
55 "“Let me try it first,” said the Scarecrow, “for it doesn’t hurt me to"
55 "get thrown about.” He walked up to another tree, as he spoke, but its"
55 "branches immediately seized him and tossed him back again."
55 ""
55 "“This is strange,” exclaimed Dorothy. “What shall we do?”"
55 ""
55 "“The trees seem to have made up their minds to fight us, and stop our"
55 "journey,” remarked the Lion."
55 ""
55 "“I believe I will try it myself,” said the Woodman, and shouldering his"
55 "axe, he marched up to the first tree that had handled the Scarecrow so"
55 "roughly. When a big branch bent down to seize him the Woodman chopped"
55 "at it so fiercely that he cut it in two. At once the tree began shaking"
55 "all its branches as if in pain, and the Tin Woodman passed safely under"
55 "it."
55 ""
55 "“Come on!” he shouted to the others. “Be quick!” They all ran forward"
55 "and passed under the tree without injury, except Toto, who was caught"
55 "by a small branch and shaken until he howled. But the Woodman promptly"
55 "chopped off the branch and set the little dog free."
55 ""
55 "The other trees of the forest did nothing to keep them back, so they"
55 "made up their minds that only the first row of trees could bend down"
55 "their branches, and that probably these were the policemen of the"
55 "forest, and given this wonderful power in order to keep strangers out"
55 "of it."
55 ""
55 "The four travelers walked with ease through the trees until they came"
55 "to the farther edge of the wood. Then, to their surprise, they found"
55 "before them a high wall which seemed to be made of white china. It was"
55 "smooth, like the surface of a dish, and higher than their heads."
55 ""
55 "“What shall we do now?” asked Dorothy."
55 ""
55 "“I will make a ladder,” said the Tin Woodman, “for we certainly must"
55 "climb over the wall.”"

55 "While the Woodman was making a ladder from wood which he found in the"

55 "After a time the ladder was finished. It looked clumsy, but the Tin"
55 "Woodman was sure it was strong and would answer their purpose. The"

55 "ladder was ready. The Scarecrow climbed up the ladder first, but he was"
55 "so awkward that Dorothy had to follow close behind and keep him from"

55 "“Go on,” exclaimed Dorothy."

55 "So the Scarecrow climbed farther up and sat down on the top of the"

55 "Then Toto came up, and immediately began to bark, but Dorothy made him"

55 "down and saw a strange sight."
55 ""
55 "Before them was a great stretch of country having a floor as smooth and"
55 "shining and white as the bottom of a big platter. Scattered around were"
55 "many houses made entirely of china and painted in the brightest colors."
55 "These houses were quite small, the biggest of them reaching only as"
55 "high as Dorothy’s waist. There were also pretty little barns, with"
55 "china fences around them; and many cows and sheep and horses and pigs"
55 "and chickens, all made of china, were standing about in groups."
55 ""
55 "But the strangest of all were the people who lived in this queer"
55 "country. There were milkmaids and shepherdesses, with brightly colored"
55 "bodices and golden spots all over their gowns; and princesses with most"
55 "gorgeous frocks of silver and gold and purple; and shepherds dressed in"
55 "knee breeches with pink and yellow and blue stripes down them, and"
55 "golden buckles on their shoes; and princes with jeweled crowns upon"
55 "their heads, wearing ermine robes and satin doublets; and funny clowns"
55 "in ruffled gowns, with round red spots upon their cheeks and tall,"
55 "pointed caps. And, strangest of all, these people were all made of"
55 "china, even to their clothes, and were so small that the tallest of"
55 "them was no higher than Dorothy’s knee."
55 ""
55 "No one did so much as look at the travelers at first, except one little"
55 "purple china dog with an extra-large head, which came to the wall and"
55 "barked at them in a tiny voice, afterwards running away again."
55 ""
55 "“How shall we get down?” asked Dorothy."
55 ""
55 "They found the ladder so heavy they could not pull it up, so the"
55 "Scarecrow fell off the wall and the others jumped down upon him so that"
55 "the hard floor would not hurt their feet. Of course they took pains not"
55 "to light on his head and get the pins in their feet. When all were"
55 "safely down they picked up the Scarecrow, whose body was quite"
55 "flattened out, and patted his straw into shape again."
55 ""
55 "“We must cross this strange place in order to get to the other side,”"
55 "said Dorothy, “for it would be unwise for us to go any other way except"
55 "due South.”"
55 ""
55 "They began walking through the country of the china people, and the"
55 "first thing they came to was a china milkmaid milking a china cow. As"
55 "they drew near, the cow suddenly gave a kick and kicked over the stool,"
55 "the pail, and even the milkmaid herself, and all fell on the china"
55 "ground with a great clatter."
55 ""
55 "Dorothy was shocked to see that the cow had broken her leg off, and"
55 "that the pail was lying in several small pieces, while the poor"
55 "milkmaid had a nick in her left elbow."
55 ""
55 "“There!” cried the milkmaid angrily. “See what you have done! My cow"
55 "has broken her leg, and I must take her to the mender’s shop and have"
55 "it glued on again. What do you mean by coming here and frightening my"
55 "cow?”"
55 ""
55 "“I’m very sorry,” returned Dorothy. “Please forgive us.”"
55 ""
55 "But the pretty milkmaid was much too vexed to make any answer. She"
55 "picked up the leg sulkily and led her cow away, the poor animal limping"
55 "on three legs. As she left them the milkmaid cast many reproachful"
55 "glances over her shoulder at the clumsy strangers, holding her nicked"
55 "elbow close to her side."
55 ""
55 "Dorothy was quite grieved at this mishap."
55 ""
55 "“We must be very careful here,” said the kind-hearted Woodman, “or we"
55 "may hurt these pretty little people so they will never get over it.”"
55 ""
55 "A little farther on Dorothy met a most beautifully dressed young"
55 "Princess, who stopped short as she saw the strangers and started to run"
55 "away."
55 ""
55 "Dorothy wanted to see more of the Princess, so she ran after her. But"
55 "the china girl cried out:"
55 ""
55 "“Don’t chase me! Don’t chase me!”"

55 "She had such a frightened little voice that Dorothy stopped and said,"
55 "“Why not?”"

55 "“Because,” answered the Princess, also stopping, a safe distance away,"

55 "often that he is mended in a hundred places, and doesn’t look at all"
55 "pretty. Here he comes now, so you can see for yourself.”"

55 "Indeed, a jolly little clown came walking toward them, and Dorothy"
55 "could see that in spite of his pretty clothes of red and yellow and"
55 "green he was completely covered with cracks, running every which way"
55 "and showing plainly that he had been mended in many places."
55 ""
55 "The Clown put his hands in his pockets, and after puffing out his"
55 "cheeks and nodding his head at them saucily, he said:"

55 "“Well, that’s respect, I expect,” declared the Clown, and immediately"
55 "stood upon his head."

55 "“Oh, I don’t mind him a bit,” said Dorothy. “But you are so beautiful,”"
55 "she continued, “that I am sure I could love you dearly. Won’t you let"
55 "me carry you back to Kansas, and stand you on Aunt Em’s mantel? I could"
55 "carry you in my basket.”"
55 ""
55 "“That would make me very unhappy,” answered the china Princess. “You"
55 "see, here in our country we live contentedly, and can talk and move"
55 "around as we please. But whenever any of us are taken away our joints"
55 "at once stiffen, and we can only stand straight and look pretty. Of"
55 "course that is all that is expected of us when we are on mantels and"
55 "cabinets and drawing-room tables, but our lives are much pleasanter"
55 "here in our own country.”"

55 ""
55 "“Good-bye,” replied the Princess."

55 "They walked carefully through the china country. The little animals and"
55 "all the people scampered out of their way, fearing the strangers would"
55 "break them, and after an hour or so the travelers reached the other"
55 "side of the country and came to another china wall."
55 ""
55 "It was not so high as the first, however, and by standing upon the"
55 "Lion’s back they all managed to scramble to the top. Then the Lion"
55 "gathered his legs under him and jumped on the wall; but just as he"
55 "jumped, he upset a china church with his tail and smashed it all to"
55 "pieces."
55 ""
55 "“That was too bad,” said Dorothy, “but really I think we were lucky in"
55 "not doing these little people more harm than breaking a cow’s leg and a"
55 "church. They are all so brittle!”"
55 ""
55 "“They are, indeed,” said the Scarecrow, “and I am thankful I am made of"

55 "through the forest he seizes an animal with a leg and drags it to his"
55 "mouth, where he eats it as a spider does a fly. Not one of us is safe"

55 "“Are there any other lions in this forest?” he asked."

55 "King of the Forest?” inquired the Lion."

55 "coarse black hair. It had a great mouth, with a row of sharp teeth a"
55 "foot long; but its head was joined to the pudgy body by a neck as"
55 "slender as a wasp’s waist. This gave the Lion a hint of the best way to"
55 "attack the creature, and as he knew it was easier to fight it asleep"
55 "than awake, he gave a great spring and landed directly upon the"
55 "monster’s back. Then, with one blow of his heavy paw, all armed with"

55 "first rock when they heard a rough voice cry out, “Keep back!”"
55 ""
55 "“Who are you?” asked the Scarecrow."
55 ""
55 "Then a head showed itself over the rock and the same voice said, “This"
55 "hill belongs to us, and we don’t allow anyone to cross it.”"
55 ""
55 "“But we must cross it,” said the Scarecrow. “We’re going to the country"
55 "of the Quadlings.”"
55 ""
55 "“But you shall not!” replied the voice, and there stepped from behind"
55 "the rock the strangest man the travelers had ever seen."
55 ""
55 "He was quite short and stout and had a big head, which was flat at the"
55 "top and supported by a thick neck full of wrinkles. But he had no arms"
55 "at all, and, seeing this, the Scarecrow did not fear that so helpless a"
55 "creature could prevent them from climbing the hill. So he said, “I’m"
55 "sorry not to do as you wish, but we must pass over your hill whether"
55 "you like it or not,” and he walked boldly forward."
55 ""
55 "As quick as lightning the man’s head shot forward and his neck"
55 "stretched out until the top of the head, where it was flat, struck the"
55 "Scarecrow in the middle and sent him tumbling, over and over, down the"
55 "hill. Almost as quickly as it came the head went back to the body, and"
55 "the man laughed harshly as he said, “It isn’t as easy as you think!”"
55 ""
55 "A chorus of boisterous laughter came from the other rocks, and Dorothy"
55 "saw hundreds of the armless Hammer-Heads upon the hillside, one behind"
55 "every rock."
55 ""
55 "The Lion became quite angry at the laughter caused by the Scarecrow’s"
55 "mishap, and giving a loud roar that echoed like thunder, he dashed up"
55 "the hill."
55 ""
55 "Again a head shot swiftly out, and the great Lion went rolling down the"
55 "hill as if he had been struck by a cannon ball."
55 ""
55 "Dorothy ran down and helped the Scarecrow to his feet, and the Lion"
55 "came up to her, feeling rather bruised and sore, and said, “It is"
55 "useless to fight people with shooting heads; no one can withstand"
55 "them.”"
55 ""
55 "“What can we do, then?” she asked."
55 ""
55 "“Call the Winged Monkeys,” suggested the Tin Woodman. “You have still"
55 "the right to command them once more.”"
55 ""
55 "“Very well,” she answered, and putting on the Golden Cap she uttered"
55 "the magic words. The Monkeys were as prompt as ever, and in a few"
55 "moments the entire band stood before her."
55 ""
55 "“What are your commands?” inquired the King of the Monkeys, bowing low."
55 ""
55 "“Carry us over the hill to the country of the Quadlings,” answered the"
55 "girl."
55 ""
55 "“It shall be done,” said the King, and at once the Winged Monkeys"
55 "caught the four travelers and Toto up in their arms and flew away with"
55 "them. As they passed over the hill the Hammer-Heads yelled with"
55 "vexation, and shot their heads high in the air, but they could not"
55 "reach the Winged Monkeys, which carried Dorothy and her comrades safely"
55 "over the hill and set them down in the beautiful country of the"
55 "Quadlings."
55 ""
55 "“This is the last time you can summon us,” said the leader to Dorothy;"
55 "“so good-bye and good luck to you.”"
55 ""
55 "“Good-bye, and thank you very much,” returned the girl; and the Monkeys"
55 "rose into the air and were out of sight in a twinkling."
55 ""
55 "The country of the Quadlings seemed rich and happy. There was field"
55 "upon field of ripening grain, with well-paved roads running between,"
55 "and pretty rippling brooks with strong bridges across them. The fences"
55 "and houses and bridges were all painted bright red, just as they had"
55 "been painted yellow in the country of the Winkies and blue in the"
55 "country of the Munchkins. The Quadlings themselves, who were short and"
55 "fat and looked chubby and good-natured, were dressed all in red, which"
55 "showed bright against the green grass and the yellowing grain."
55 ""
55 "The Monkeys had set them down near a farmhouse, and the four travelers"
55 "walked up to it and knocked at the door. It was opened by the farmer’s"
55 "wife, and when Dorothy asked for something to eat the woman gave them"
55 "all a good dinner, with three kinds of cake and four kinds of cookies,"
55 "and a bowl of milk for Toto."
55 ""
55 "“How far is it to the Castle of Glinda?” asked the child."
55 ""
55 "“It is not a great way,” answered the farmer’s wife. “Take the road to"
55 "the South and you will soon reach it.”"
55 ""
55 "Thanking the good woman, they started afresh and walked by the fields"
55 "and across the pretty bridges until they saw before them a very"
55 "beautiful Castle. Before the gates were three young girls, dressed in"
55 "handsome red uniforms trimmed with gold braid; and as Dorothy"
55 "approached, one of them said to her:"
55 ""
55 "“Why have you come to the South Country?”"
55 ""
55 "“To see the Good Witch who rules here,” she answered. “Will you take me"
55 "to her?”"
55 ""
55 "“Let me have your name, and I will ask Glinda if she will receive you.”"
55 "They told who they were, and the girl soldier went into the Castle."
55 "After a few moments she came back to say that Dorothy and the others"
55 "were to be admitted at once."

55 "Before they went to see Glinda, however, they were taken to a room of"
55 "the Castle, where Dorothy washed her face and combed her hair, and the"
55 "Lion shook the dust out of his mane, and the Scarecrow patted himself"
55 "into his best shape, and the Woodman polished his tin and oiled his"
55 "joints."
55 ""
55 "When they were all quite presentable they followed the soldier girl"
55 "into a big room where the Witch Glinda sat upon a throne of rubies."
55 ""
55 "She was both beautiful and young to their eyes. Her hair was a rich red"
55 "in color and fell in flowing ringlets over her shoulders. Her dress was"
55 "pure white but her eyes were blue, and they looked kindly upon the"
55 "little girl."
55 ""
55 "“What can I do for you, my child?” she asked."
55 ""
55 "Dorothy told the Witch all her story: how the cyclone had brought her"
55 "to the Land of Oz, how she had found her companions, and of the"
55 "wonderful adventures they had met with."
55 ""
55 "“My greatest wish now,” she added, “is to get back to Kansas, for Aunt"
55 "Em will surely think something dreadful has happened to me, and that"
55 "will make her put on mourning; and unless the crops are better this"
55 "year than they were last, I am sure Uncle Henry cannot afford it.”"
55 ""
55 "Glinda leaned forward and kissed the sweet, upturned face of the loving"
55 "little girl."
55 ""
55 "“Bless your dear heart,” she said, “I am sure I can tell you of a way"
55 "to get back to Kansas.” Then she added, “But, if I do, you must give me"
55 "the Golden Cap.”"
55 ""
55 "“Willingly!” exclaimed Dorothy; “indeed, it is of no use to me now, and"
55 "when you have it you can command the Winged Monkeys three times.”"
55 ""
55 "“And I think I shall need their service just those three times,”"
55 "answered Glinda, smiling."
55 ""
55 "Dorothy then gave her the Golden Cap, and the Witch said to the"
55 "Scarecrow, “What will you do when Dorothy has left us?”"
55 ""
55 "“I will return to the Emerald City,” he replied, “for Oz has made me"
55 "its ruler and the people like me. The only thing that worries me is how"
55 "to cross the hill of the Hammer-Heads.”"
55 ""
55 "“By means of the Golden Cap I shall command the Winged Monkeys to carry"
55 "you to the gates of the Emerald City,” said Glinda, “for it would be a"
55 "shame to deprive the people of so wonderful a ruler.”"
55 ""
55 "“Am I really wonderful?” asked the Scarecrow."
55 ""
55 "“You are unusual,” replied Glinda."
55 ""
55 "Turning to the Tin Woodman, she asked, “What will become of you when"
55 "Dorothy leaves this country?”"
55 ""
55 "He leaned on his axe and thought a moment. Then he said, “The Winkies"
55 "were very kind to me, and wanted me to rule over them after the Wicked"
55 "Witch died. I am fond of the Winkies, and if I could get back again to"
55 "the Country of the West, I should like nothing better than to rule over"
55 "them forever.”"
55 ""
55 "“My second command to the Winged Monkeys,” said Glinda “will be that"
55 "they carry you safely to the land of the Winkies. Your brain may not be"
55 "so large to look at as those of the Scarecrow, but you are really"
55 "brighter than he is—when you are well polished—and I am sure you will"
55 "rule the Winkies wisely and well.”"
55 ""
55 "Then the Witch looked at the big, shaggy Lion and asked, “When Dorothy"
55 "has returned to her own home, what will become of you?”"
55 ""
55 "“Over the hill of the Hammer-Heads,” he answered, “lies a grand old"
55 "forest, and all the beasts that live there have made me their King. If"
55 "I could only get back to this forest, I would pass my life very happily"
55 "there.”"
55 ""
55 "“My third command to the Winged Monkeys,” said Glinda, “shall be to"
55 "carry you to your forest. Then, having used up the powers of the Golden"
55 "Cap, I shall give it to the King of the Monkeys, that he and his band"
55 "may thereafter be free for evermore.”"
55 ""
55 "The Scarecrow and the Tin Woodman and the Lion now thanked the Good"
55 "Witch earnestly for her kindness; and Dorothy exclaimed:"
55 ""
55 "“You are certainly as good as you are beautiful! But you have not yet"
55 "told me how to get back to Kansas.”"
55 ""
55 "“Your Silver Shoes will carry you over the desert,” replied Glinda. “If"
55 "you had known their power you could have gone back to your Aunt Em the"
55 "very first day you came to this country.”"
55 ""
55 "“But then I should not have had my wonderful brains!” cried the"
55 "Scarecrow. “I might have passed my whole life in the farmer’s"
55 "cornfield.”"
55 ""
55 "“And I should not have had my lovely heart,” said the Tin Woodman. “I"
55 "might have stood and rusted in the forest till the end of the world.”"
55 ""
55 "“And I should have lived a coward forever,” declared the Lion, “and no"
55 "beast in all the forest would have had a good word to say to me.”"
55 ""
55 "“This is all true,” said Dorothy, “and I am glad I was of use to these"
55 "good friends. But now that each of them has had what he most desired,"
55 "and each is happy in having a kingdom to rule besides, I think I should"
55 "like to go back to Kansas.”"
55 ""
55 "“The Silver Shoes,” said the Good Witch, “have wonderful powers. And"
55 "one of the most curious things about them is that they can carry you to"
55 "any place in the world in three steps, and each step will be made in"
55 "the wink of an eye. All you have to do is to knock the heels together"
55 "three times and command the shoes to carry you wherever you wish to"
55 "go.”"
55 ""
55 "“If that is so,” said the child joyfully, “I will ask them to carry me"

55 ""
55 "She threw her arms around the Lion’s neck and kissed him, patting his"
55 "big head tenderly. Then she kissed the Tin Woodman, who was weeping in"
55 "a way most dangerous to his joints. But she hugged the soft, stuffed"
55 "body of the Scarecrow in her arms instead of kissing his painted face,"
55 "and found she was crying herself at this sorrowful parting from her"
55 "loving comrades."
55 ""
55 "Glinda the Good stepped down from her ruby throne to give the little"

55 "Dorothy now took Toto up solemnly in her arms, and having said one last"

55 "Instantly she was whirling through the air, so swiftly that all she"

55 "The Silver Shoes took but three steps, and then she stopped so suddenly"
55 "that she rolled over upon the grass several times before she knew where"

55 ""
55 "At length, however, she sat up and looked about her."
55 ""
55 "“Good gracious!” she cried."
55 ""
55 "For she was sitting on the broad Kansas prairie, and just before her"
55 "was the new farmhouse Uncle Henry built after the cyclone had carried"
